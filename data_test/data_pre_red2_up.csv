AngelsMessenger,"Hi there, I am sorry you are losing your loved one. It sucks as I lost my sister in 2022 to breast cancer. I am a religious person and a Christian. It‚Äôs okay if some people don‚Äôt agree with me, but what comforted me when my sister passed away was knowing she was going into a deep ‚Äúsleep.‚Äù The Bible calls death a sleep. On that day their thoughts perish, and their breath ‚Äúspirit‚Äù goes back to the life-giver God, and his body returns to the dust of the ground. I believe my sister is sleeping and awaiting the resurrection. Genesis 3:19. So this comforts me in that she is not seeing all the pain going on in our world, but sleeping in her grave.

Infinite_Purple1123,"Right now you have to take care of yourself. And enjoy whatever time you have with him. I lost my dad last year to aggressive lung cancer. He did smoke but he has quit 6 years before he got sick, and it just didn't matter. The one thing I wish more than anything is that more of the family had shared the caregiving with me so I could have been his daughter more and his caregiver less. As for what's next, I can't say anything definitively, but here's what I believe: The first law of thermodynamics is that energy can neither be created, nor can it be destroyed. The soul is often described as the spark. A spark is energy. The human soul is energy. When our loved ones die, it's not their soul dying. It's the vessel that carried that spark breaking down. So their energy WILL carry on. It will cycle again. Your loved one isn't ending. The spark that made them them is just finding a new purpose. Because that energy can never destroyed. The spark that makes your dad who he is will make its way back into the world. What form it takes is unknown. But his energy is going to get to see the world in a way the living can only dream. Of. Not the end of the adventure. Just the next leg of the journey. I dunno if that helps, but it's given me solace in losing both my mom and dad.

Informal-Cod6895,"Hi u/Top_Succotash9573, I am so very sorry your family is going through this. My mom was diagnosed with S4 lung cancer a few years ago and I was in a very similar place with it all. She is the most health-conscious person I know, never smoked, meditates daily, and is very in tune with her body - this took us all for a huge roller coaster ride. What advice I can offer is to be gentle with yourself (not ""strong"") during this time of grieving. Try taking the perspective of ""we are taking things one day at a time"" rather than trying to force acceptance of the situation. Acceptance will develop gradually in its own, subtle way. Do something for yourself each day, it is important to take care of your own health (slow walk around the park, cup of tea, resting in the sun). Reach out to your community (like you are doing now!) - it is shocking how many people have been touched by cancer and will show up to support you. The earliest days are the scariest because you feel in utter limbo waiting for the specific diagnosis and treatment plans. For us, this took around 6 months to get sorted. During this time, I just kept repeating to myself ""there is no better time or place in the world to have cancer."" The interventions have come SUCH a long way! We are over 4 years out from her initial diagnosis and she has had no new growth for the past 2 years.

Sandz86_,"I completely understand what you‚Äôre feeling. My mum was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer last year; she turns 67 this year. I mourn our old life more than anything which is natural I suppose. My mum was on targeted chemotherapy treatment but she‚Äôs had a new growth in her lower back which means a change of treatment to two varieties of chemo. I was hopefully she would last at least a couple of years on the targeted treatment before progression but what‚Äôs meant to be will be. The most frustrating part of this process is not knowing what is going to happen next. I keep telling myself I should be grateful she‚Äôs still here, seeing as when she was diagnosed I didn‚Äôt think she‚Äôd make it to the summer of last year let alone where we are. As for what happens after this existence; I can‚Äôt say I have a definitive belief on that but what I can say is my mum and I have conversations about death, not in a morbid way but just to talk about it. She always says if it‚Äôs her time to go all she asks is that she doesn‚Äôt suffer. As another commenter has written; energy cannot be destroyed, a part of our loved ones stays alive within us, that little piece of them and the love we felt for them is what we carry forward with us when they‚Äôre gone.

dirkwoods,Wow. Sorry to hear about your bad news. I am a retired physician. I do not know the details of your case but I suspect that there was some miscommunication of some kind. Do not accept the nurse's assessment of your situation as the final word. If you have MyChart I would reach out to the Oncologist and ask about this in terms of possible miscommunication or possibly being confused about what the nurse said. You should also be given the chance to speak with the Radiation Oncologist as the expert on Friday at your appointment. I would place far more faith in what the Radiation Oncologist says. I had spinal lesions causing sciatica and had the start of motor weakness. I received radiation to the spine which reversed the pain and my motor strength has returned to normal. It seems to me if you have been told you might be paralyzed by this lesion that someone should have done a motor exam on you (formally tested your strength right now). As you are reaching out to the Oncologist and your PCP you might ask if anyone is concerned enough that you should have a motor exam or be placed on steroids awaiting the radiation (if both haven't already been done). In my case I was placed on high dose steroids awaiting the first radiation treatment. I suspect they might do the same for you. Good luck. This is part of what makes cancer so fun.

I declined and drove to the hospital because it's literally right behind her office. I had a catscan guided biopsy for my abdomen where they found a 10cm tumor that was entirely new. When the MRI came back on my spine it showed a 3cm tumor with extensions into the soft tissue around L2. They contacted radiology and scheduled me for 5 treatments that ended on Thursday. The pain is a little better (being on the radiation table was the worst). And I'm told the tumor is dying.

mistermoondog,Hi Star‚ÄîSorry the two of you are stuck with this‚Äîcancer has been a fact of life in my family for 50 years.

ran44445,"Sending you and your dad warm thoughts. My mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung cancer in february. She had not smoked in 46 years and at age 85 was the picture of health. We were all shocked. It is an emotional rollercoaster with the first month being especially bad. My mom was very depressed. I had a panic attack with my heart rate skyrocketing to 167. Fast forward to now, mom is in a clinical trial and how interesting it was that once she started treatment her emotional state got much better as she is doing what she can to stabilize while it is not curable. Take care of yourself, and enjoy every minute you can with your dad. These are rough waters to navigate. The people in this forum are kind and very wise. I often get nuggets of something that helps me. One very wise person in this forum said ‚Äú they are living with cancer vs focusing on dying from cancer.‚Äù I think of those words daily.
