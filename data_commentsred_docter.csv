dirkwoods,Wow. Sorry to hear about your bad news. I am a retired physician. I do not know the details of your case but I suspect that there was some miscommunication of some kind. Do not accept the nurse's assessment of your situation as the final word. If you have MyChart I would reach out to the Oncologist and ask about this in terms of possible miscommunication or possibly being confused about what the nurse said. You should also be given the chance to speak with the Radiation Oncologist as the expert on Friday at your appointment. I would place far more faith in what the Radiation Oncologist says. I had spinal lesions causing sciatica and had the start of motor weakness. I received radiation to the spine which reversed the pain and my motor strength has returned to normal. It seems to me if you have been told you might be paralyzed by this lesion that someone should have done a motor exam on you (formally tested your strength right now). As you are reaching out to the Oncologist and your PCP you might ask if anyone is concerned enough that you should have a motor exam or be placed on steroids awaiting the radiation (if both haven't already been done). In my case I was placed on high dose steroids awaiting the first radiation treatment. I suspect they might do the same for you. Good luck. This is part of what makes cancer so fun. Even as a physician I find the communication issues maddening.,1456
Aware-Locksmith-7313,Dirkwoods … Your observations are quite informative and make a great deal of sense. Best to you. … Maddening is the key word for OP’s situation with a nurse (an NP in action?) blathering about paralysis based only on on a scan.,237
puffedovenpancake,I just wanted to pop in and send some calming and healthy vibes. This is a big shock. I’m so sorry. I’m stage iv lung and it’s been a roller coaster. Do you have a palliative care doctor? Mine has been amazing helping me sort through medications and symptoms and feelings etc.,286
gemurmel,"I'm so sorry to hear this. For me, it was the other way round. CC spread to my spine and then to my lungs. But my spine is fine now. I get chemo+immunotherapy for my lungs. Have you talked to a neurosurgeon yet? They basically removed my T1 vertebrae, put some titanium plate in, then did 22 rounds of radiation and after that it was gone from my spine and still is. Don't listen to what an oncology nurse tells you, speak to the specialists whos job it is to treat cancer to the spine. Good luck!",521
beeboobum,"Stage 4 ovarian here. Please find a palliative care doctor asap- it was suggested to me from a fellow cancer survivor and I’m so glad I did. Once cancer has metastasized, it is typically a rollercoaster. In and out of remission. I’m currently in remission but I understand cancer is something i will be living with forever. Don’t be scared. You are alive and not paralyzed today and may never be paralyzed with prompt treatment. You can do this.",455
PenExactly,Inappropriate for a nurse to tell you that. Don’t panic. Talk to your oncologist. And report the nurse for giving such a dire prognosis.,148
Aware-Locksmith-7313,"Regret you’ve had such spread, and am wondering why concerning news like that is being delivered via phone by a nurse and not by your oncologist? Unacceptable.",170
Stickyduck468,Well that is a real kick in the teeth. So sorry for this difficult time.,82
Wyde1340,"I'm sorry to hear this, but here's some hope: I had cancer in many bones, but had radiation on the worse of them: hips, pelvis and femurs (I ended up breaking one femur in the middle of radiation, but the rest of the bone mets disappeared. Have hope!",261
BitsiBones,"I think I should clarify, in the UK cancer patients have a CNS (clinical nurse specialist) who is your personal oncology specialist nurse, she's not just a regular nurse. They're very specialised in your cancer and you're on a one-to-one basis with them they way you don't really get with your oncologist. Tbh I wouldn't have expected to get that news from anyone else, she's kind of your oncologist 2.0 so to speak.",426
skelterjohn,"That's really rough, sorry to hear about that outcome.",64
assisianinmomjeans,I have breast cancer metastasis to the spine. It’s been 9 years and I’m NED. Spinal mets are not always a paralyzer. I don’t know many people who have become paralyzed for spine mets.,193
Aware-Locksmith-7313,Yeah but OP’s nursey poo apparently thinks she knows all about how to read a scan and deliver dire news over the phone.,129
luckysevensampson,"I’m so sorry that you have to go through this. What I suspect the nurse said was “single fraction” rather than “ single section”. Each radiation dose is called a fraction, and they’re usually spaced apart in time so that the healthy cells have time to recover but the cancer cells don’t. Definitely see a radiation oncologist, and they can explain why it’s a single fraction. Best of luck with your treatment.",419
3DLeeLee,Get that second opinion baby Don't listen to that nurse I have stage 4: cervical cancer and I'm doing physical therapy because my Tivdak treatment was too strong and weakened my legs and had me walking like Daffy Duck due to neuropathy of my toes I know mine is a different situation and I'm terrified of everything cancerous as well but you got this I'm seeing a therapist journaling and called a cancer support group Friend For Life to talk about my cancer My friends and family isn't any help in this dept You will be surprised at who have gone through what and some of the same things as well and can give you great advice about different organizations that can help you I've heard of the operation on the spine as well DONT NOBODY WANT TO BE PARALYZED If you're able go ahead and start doing little exercises around your house or at the gym or get you some physical therapy to kick cancers ***You have to get in front of it If you're religious get those prayers going but that's not for everyone I feel what you are going through and rjust yesterday I felt bat shit crazy Im mean as hell Can't gain my weight back I have back pain The pharmacy plays with my meds but i still struggle to make it through Its a tough lonely horrible road I lost my father to prostate cancer 2 yrs ago That man was my superhero Oooooowwwee me and cancer go way back I AM FIGHTING AND I WANT YOU TO FIGHT YOU GOT THIS ♥️,1416
FrogAnToad,I had cancer throughout skeleton including inside cervical vertebrae. Two years later im still doing fine. Dont trust yr nurse. Even if it were true the way she told you is inexcusable.,195
pthrizzle,I’m so sorry. Sending prayers up and hopeful thoughts your way.,73
ReferenceSufficient,"In US, Nurses aren't suppose to give you test results, diagnosis, It's the Doctor that will inform you. Call the doctor and tell them what nurse told you.What country do you live in?",194
mmmonicapb,Im so sorry you received this tough news today. Go look for a second and a third opinion if necessary. So many of us internet strangers root for you. Feel free to DM if you need to talk.,196
This-Army6223,Okay first your nurse never should have said that. My cousin has lung cancer that traveled to her spine and fractured vertebrae. She was able to have radiation and surgery to stabilize the area and she is NOT paralyzed . Those lesions are now stable. There is no way for someone to know what she told you for sure. I'm sorry you're on this path. I am dealing with bone mets as well .,398
No-Count-2035,"Hi OP Im from sweden and here we also have our own specialist nurse that we talk to frequently. But I have to point out that sometimes my nurse could say things that turned out differently so I think the best thing is always to talk to your oncologist. I think its very easy for miscommunication and ultimatley, our nurses arent the experts on our cancer. They’re knowledgeable and have experience sure, but that doesnt make them experts like the oncologists. Also, I’ve had cancer in my spine, which even caused a fracture and compression (basically the entire vertebra is ruined and my spine is instable). But nobody said anything about getting paralyzed. Sounds so strange your nurse would just call you and tell you over the phone. Also, I believe surgery usually is an option for spine mets, especially to prevent paralysis. I hope you get more clear answers soon!",894
merce007,"I'm in a similar situation, I had great success with my hysterectomy in the middle of April, they got all of the cancer in the pelvis and abdomen and the lesions on my liver were so small they couldn't find them to ablate them. I had a catscan at the end of last month that indicated new liver and lung mets, and at my next follow up my Oncologist suggested she call an ambulance and get me to the hospital because I was having severe pain in my back, abdomen, pelvis and groin. I declined and drove to the hospital because it's literally right behind her office. I had a catscan guided biopsy for my abdomen where they found a 10cm tumor that was entirely new. When the MRI came back on my spine it showed a 3cm tumor with extensions into the soft tissue around L2. They contacted radiology and scheduled me for 5 treatments that ended on Thursday. The pain is a little better (being on the radiation table was the worst). And I'm told the tumor is dying. So the 10cm tumor in my abdomen was impinging upon my ureters coming from both kidneys, and yesterday they put Stents in to open them up. My back pain has improved. My advice would be to get a second opinion and if you're in the NE/SE Jersey/NY region reach out and I'll get you the info for my care team if you're interested.",1335
