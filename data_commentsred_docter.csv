CowRaptorCatLady,"They are correct eat anything when you can, you lose appetite when on chemo it can make your mouth sore they tell you eat anything you can when you can to keep your body going. No food is going to help treatment really the only thing it need to do is fuel the body it keep it going.",293
Sunshine12e,"I had to eat absolute crap food during treatments (because it was during total lockdowns and I was stuck out of country and banned from eating any fresh produce (even if cooked) or dairy (as it is unpasteurized). I had gotten horrid, horrid food poisoning, and the doctor told me to only eat foods with ""preservatives"" as she pointed to the preservatives on a tetra-pack sugar-added juice. I mostly ate plain pasta with some Italian seasoning from packets from pizza places, rice, beans, junk food....especially as the import stores began running out of more and more stock and could not replace. Anyway, the medicines did their work and I am now NED. Also have a relative with a stage 4 diagnosis, for a cancer that has much less survival. She also ate what she could eat, and is also currently NED. We like to think that food makes all the difference, but really it is the strong medications. Also, I ate a very healthy diet for most of my life, so it didn't help me to not get cancer🤷‍♀️. Most important for her to not stress about it and get what nutrients and calories that she can stomach.",1105
nevereatthecompany,"The challenge will be to.get enough calories in, and anything she wants to eat is a win. Whether or not a food is healthy really doesn't matter, because no food is worse than eating nothing",199
TerracottaGarden,"I lost 30 lbs. on chemo. 4 Rounds. Your mom is starting at 110. See where this goes? This is why she should eat anything that appeals to her, regardless of how unhealthy or inflammatory, you may feel it is. Chemo itself is going to be ""unhealthy"" -- that's why it works. The last thing she needs at this juncture is to become frail from lack of bodily reserves. This is why oncologists stress eating whatever and whenever one can. She is also going to be severely fatigued, so ""junk"" and ultra-processed microwavable stuff may just be what tides her over when she can barely make it to the kitchen. And don't worry about supplements during chemo! Unless her doc prescribes specific supplements, it has no place right now in her diet, and could in fact counteract her treatment. I admire your caring about your mom, but don't let perfection be the enemy of ""good enough"".",895
AlRad42,"I’m on chemo for life, almost three years in so far. Trust me - let her eat whatever she wants and can tolerate. This will change from cycle to cycle, and it’s different during the cycles too. If she has a craving and it sits well, good. Lots of fluids. Some days she won’t want much or anything at all, so just catch up later when she’s better. But keep pushing those fluids. Some foods satisfy an emotional need and that’s important too. Comfort goes a long way when the chemo has you beat down. Best of luck to all of you ❤️",552
slythwolf,The priority on chemo is for the patient to get enough calories. You eat whatever you can keep down.,110
CoffeeChesirecat,"Before my dad's stage 4 diagnosis, I had all sorts of ideas of what a person (ill or not) should eat. All of that changed when I realized his oncologist was right in having him eat whatever he wanted and tolerated. We are still trying to figure out what that is. It changes day to day, hour to hour even. We are just focusing on keeping food down and weight on. Hope your mom heals and wins this battle <3",422
Glad-Hospital6756,"Ultimately, just eating something is the goal. When she can barely eat later, that extra layer of fat will come in handy. I actually ended my cancer journey 40 lbs heavier, but that’s because I was 40 lbs under at one point and that’s worse than anything else. Sometimes when you’re craving a certain food, it is the ONLY thing you can keep down. If all she wants is chicken tenders and mac and cheese, trust me it’s better than nothing.",461
Constantlearner01,Look at some of the Ensure protein drinks. They hand those out during chemo to me.,92
Ok-Zebra-5349,Listen to the doctor. That is what I was also told.,61
EtonRd,"The first thing in your post is that your mother is very active and eats relatively healthy. Why are you including that information? It has no value. Your mom was active and healthy and now she has stage IV cancer. So clearly running and eating healthy didn’t prevent cancer. It’s a non-issue. Leave your mother alone and let her eat what she wants to eat. Don’t give her any supplements, you’re not a doctor you’re not a healthcare worker. If her oncologist said she can eat whatever she wants as long as she keeps her weight up, that’s what she should do. I want to have compassion for you because I know you’re just concerned about your mother, but you’re making it hard. Nowhere in your post did you say what your mother thinks or feels. It was all about you and what you want to do. Your mom is 59 years old. She’s not 99 years old. she’s perfectly capable of figuring out what she wants to eat. It’s her body that’s going to be going through chemo and she’s gonna know what she feels like eating. If you really want to help, if you find your mom is having trouble keeping her weight up, encourage her to get a consultation with a nutritionist at the cancer center.",1201
PopsiclesForChickens,"I'm sorry and it's a terrible diagnosis, but the best thing is probably what the oncologist said. There isn't any food that is going to prolong her life or kill her faster. But you (or rather your mom) can ask about a referral to a dietician if you want things a little more in depth. Personally I got through chemo eating a lot of Ben and Jerry's.....",370
verycoolbutterfly,"I agree with everyone here saying you don't need to police or worry about her diet, she's an adult and like her doctor said the goal is for her to have as many calories as possible. Especially considering that her current weight is pretty low. With that said I do understand your concerns and conflicting feelings about it. My mom smoked cigarettes, drank wine, and pretty much lived on Dominoes and Dr. Pepper throughout her treatment. It was frustrating and I would complain about it, especially the smoking omg. Then one day she kind of snapped at me and said something like ""I'm fucking dying and these are the only things I enjoy anymore"" so... yeah, fair, I shut up about it. I couldn't imagine being in that position so who was I to judge? (She was diagnosed metastatic stage a million so, this had always been the reality) After that she did start showing a little more interest in things like smoothies (maybe just to make me feel better lol) so I would make them (delicious ones, not too 'healthy') whenever she wanted. Along with the Dr Pepper which was her last drink.",1104
Aggravating-Sound690,"Trust the experts. No offense, but you are neither an oncologist, nor a nutritional scientist. You can always get a second medical opinion, but don’t start making changes to her lifestyle for health reasons unless absolutely necessary.",245
Whatasaurus_Rex,"If you want to help your mom with diet, I recommend doing whatever you can to make getting calories and nutrition easier for her. Don’t worry about supplements and inflammatory foods. I think you have good intentions but no clue about how horrible chemo can make one feel and how important her being able to keep weight on will be. You could get her food delivery gift cards or subscriptions for those services (Door Dash, etc) so your mom doesn’t have to leave the house to buy whatever sounds good to her in the moment. You could buy her paper plates and disposable cutlery so she doesn’t have to do as many dishes. You could set up a meal train for your mom and any family members who live with her to make their lives easier too. If your mom wants your help getting in more nutrition, talk to her about what she feels like she can eat, and figure out recipes that she will actually be able to consume, and make those for her. Basically, everything should be about making one aspect of her life easier and not make eating healthy a burden for her.",1074
dandelion_k,"At her weight, she needs to eat whatever she'll eat. If its ice cream all day every day, feed it to her. Being tiny on chemo is not a good thing and that cant be stressed enough. I'd rather have an overweight patient than an underweight one when it comes to stage IV cancer and aggressive treatment.",309
SquirrellyDog2016,"LeSane, Stage 4 Ovarian cancer patient here. I understand how scared you are right now. With chemo, at times food tastes ""off"" and it's very unappetizing. The nausea comes in waves on a daily basis. The best thing I did for myself is ask my oncologist's office to help me schedule an appointment with one of the oncological dieticians on staff at the hospital. Instead of trying to create a diet for her yourself, it would be so much easier if your mother does the same thing I did. I spoke with both the dietician and pharmacist about supplements along with giving them a list of meds I'm on. That will help them build a plan. Go with her to her appointments, ask questions, and take notes. Your job now will be as her daughter/caretaker/friend who will help her to navigate her way through this. If your mom is having trouble eating or is in digestive pain, the dietician will have suggestions that will help her keep food down while maximizing her nutrition. Just an FYI, a big part of my disease onset was MAJOR digestive issues. I was chronically bloated, gassy, & in pain, losing weight rapidly. A doctor friend suggested I try the FODMAP diet. It's an elimination diet. The foods listed are nutritional, non-inflammatory, and easy to digest. I found relief within a few days. It's not meant to be a long term diet but it did buy me time until I was able to see a dietician who could work up a meal plan with me. I try to avoid processed food but, some days, all I can tolerate are Coca-Colas accompanied by toast and jam or a Pop Tart. On certain days, my sole objective is to avoid the nausea and vomiting. We can't always choose the healthiest diet. We're forced to choose what our bodies will tolerate on any given day. Honey, I wish your Mom and you, all the best. The most important thing is maintaining the right mindset to get her through this. I remain positive and optimistic about my situation. I avoid any negativity that might come my way. I believe more than anything else, it's what's helping me stay strong and get through this. My body has responded beautifully to the treatment so far. I'm not saying I haven't struggled with the side effects but I will put up with whatever I have to because the alternative is dying and I'm not accepting that. If I never go into remission, I'm absolutely determined to survive as long as I can. The mind/body connection is a very powerful tool along with the positive relationships in our lives. I only deal with family and friends who are supportive. I avoid certain people I know will annoy or upset me. I have friends who update those people I prefer to have no contact with. Yesterday, the oncologist ran my cancer panel (CA-125 for ovarian cancer) is remaining steady in the ""normal"" range, she didn't feel the tumors that were there last year when I was diagnosed, and my bloodwork is very good. Today, your Mom and I, along with everyone else who has cancer, have a much better chance of survival than ever before with many more options for treatment. Breakthroughs are happening every day. Remain positive, optimistic and most importantly, strong for her. The two of you will get through this together. Sending positive thoughts your way.🤗 💖",3254
PetalumaDr,Agree with “whatever she wants”. I tried hard to fall in love with expensive protein shakes that were free to me but couldn’t. Now my wife has me on a milkshake a day and I am happy as a weight gaining clam. I find it too hard to muster enthusiasm for doing what the smartest thing would be (the protein shakes). Asking mom about her traditional guilty pleasures might be a good start.,395
Nyc12331,"Dude chemo WRECKS your appetite and taste buds. As long as she’s getting calories and isn’t just eating straight up crap let her choice what she wants! She can always tweak her diet after treatment. My BF had to learn because he bought me a lot of different food when I first got sick and I couldn’t eat any of it. My fave is eggs rn, they’re easy and nutritious, good luck! I’m sorry this is happening to your fam ❤️",427
Low_Appointment_3917,"Beef and cruciferous would be ideal. Look up bitter apricot kernels, it helped lots of people to fight cancer. You will see posts scarying people away cause it has arsenic but i never heard anyone getting poisoned from it, we ate it as kids all the time. Plus it has good nutrition value. Also pumpkin seeds (raw) have good nutrition.",344
theeeartjunky,"Definitely avoid dairy as that increases the risk of inflammation. I’m not an oncologist or dietician but I would recommend boiled eggs if she can stand them, fruits and vegetables like kale, cauliflower, spinach, brussels sprouts, carrots, legumes and beans may be a good source of protein. For some sweetness I’d advise kiwi, all melons like honey dew, watermelon, cucumber, winter/summer squash or eggplant, maybe dragon fruit, organic mango, passion fruit, papaya just to name a few. Maybe avoid starchy foods like rice, potatoes, bread, and pasta. Good luck and prayers up for your mother and her journey.",620
EtonRd,"You’re not an oncologist or a dietitian, but you have no problem giving a bunch of advice that has no scientific basis. Wonderful.",140
Whatasaurus_Rex,You’re here offering dietary advice for a medical condition that you admittedly said that you’re not professionally qualified to treat. What is the basis for your advice? Do you/did you have cancer or are/were you a caretaker and these suggestions were ones that you found personally helpful during treatment?,319
PopsiclesForChickens,I would have been incredibly sick if I tried to eat those things while I was going through treatment. I lived on carbs and (non dairy-just because I'm lactose intolerant) ice cream. I had to have a pretty low fiber diet. That sounds like a good start for an already healthy person trying to eat healthier though.,329
LesaneCrooks,Thank you kindly!!,28
