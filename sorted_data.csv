0,Basic_Government_730,"I was around that age when my sister passed from leukemia and we didn’t really have proper goodbyes but she left a voicemail of her singing me happy birthday (a few days before she died) and I listened to it all the time growing up. It got deleted when I moved out and it is gutting me even typing about it now. I was a weird kid so once I knew what she had I wanted to know everything I could about it, so I knew she’d be dying. I found having clear and objective information about the illness really helped me but that could just be the autism lol.",57
1,CarinaConstellation,Maybe give them a gift of a framed photo of you and them and a handwritten note so they can keep it. That's what my step mom did when she died.,14
2,DinnerNo2341,"Please reach out to this integrative oncology clinic. Cancer cells CAN revert to normal cells. Tumor growth CAN be restrained. But if the stress signals that caused the cells to go rogue are not addressed, you haven’t given the body a chance to change. “killing” cancer cells don’t change the terrain the cancer was thriving in. The factors that make up our environment like hormones, nutrition, stress, and inflammation are asking to be addressed. Words from Dr. Connealy http://cancercenterforhealing.com I’ve known a number of late stage patients who’ve improved with two month protocol of rectal ozone therapy and a specialized hyperbaric oxygen therapy",74
3,FearlessUse6394,"I think they are way to young to understand. You can tell them your going on a trip. And as the grow.oldet explain that your trip is taking longer ,there just to young.",18
4,GeneralTonight2401,Even a video to add with it would be nice,7
5,HistoricalFishing2,"Video cards , letters, maybe even a little teddy bear from build a bear and record a message for them to play back whenever they’d like? My thoughts are with you! 🙏🏼",22
6,ImplementDecent6114,"My husband was in a similar situation a few years ago, Stage 4 esophageal cancer. He wrote letters to our kids, nieces, nephews and a few of our best friends. I video recorded him telling stories about his mom, dad, brothers and sisters growing up. We also video recorded messages for our kids, nieces and nephews with him telling them his favorite memories of them growing up. Things that mean a lot to us. I took a few of his flannel shirts and made simple, stuffed bears with them so there would be something to give hugs for him. I took a bunch of his T shirts and made a quilt for each of our daughters. Amazing what you can do to pass the hours at the infusion center! We have all of these items in a huge box in our closet as immunotherapy was finally approved for his cancer three years ago. After having three recurrences in different organs post op, he had an immediate response to Nivolumab. That was his magic bullet and still is two + years later. I pray you get your miracle too.",104
7,Lisamccullough88,Sorry to ask this but may I ask your age and if you smoked? All my love.,11
8,Low-Future9354,This does sounds like a great idea. I feel like I'd be a mess if I tried to say a real goodbye in person!Videos are honestly a great idea. I didn't even think of videos. They could rewatch it as often as they wanted. Thanks so much for this idea. Thoughts are with you and your wife also 💚,38
9,M-Any-Wulfe,"Having kids that young who lost someone, a video/ letter would be good but if they want to see you, see them. especially the older ones. I'm so sorry.",19
10,Maximum-Awareness76,"While you're hemming and hawing over what to do, keep this in mind... they already know SOMETHING is up. By hesitating, you're allowing their imaginations to grow wild and not very positively. My niece of 12 pulled me aside, obviously in turmoil. She asked me what's going on. Turns out she thought her mom was very sick, not me! Whatever you do, do it NOW! I've seen some of the older young kids distance themselves over this. Come clean and lay the hard truth on them. We're having a ""life affirming"" party tomorrow for me, and I'll be able to answer all questions. I am an artist and will be presenting pieces to the kids as my legacy to them. They will recieve an original piece that they have admired over the years . This is a perfect opportunity to have that talk anyway. Don't let them sit in a corner and withdraw from the family. Most of the kids were very receptive, and we were able to talk about life and death. Like any lie or omission, it'll catch up with you and will be even harder. Good luck!",95
11,OnlyTheGoodDieYun,You could make a video also. Could tell them about your life or the things you like most about them. Could include life advice. God bless you. I hope you are comfortable and make progress.,23
12,PetalumaDr,"Maybe an appropriate modification of Ira Byock’s “5 things” (which started as 4). I l love you, thank you for being part of my life, I forgive you for anything you may regret, please forgive me for anything I did which may have hurt you, I believe in you. Again it depends on the relationship and age but I find those 5 things to be an awesome start.",43
13,Plastic_Leg_3812,I agree with writing them a little message along with any photos you may have of yourself with them. They will cherish it. I mostly just wanted to say you sound like a wonderful person for caring so much about their feelings. I’m so sorry you are going through this.,27
14,PyewacketPonsonby,I have stage 4 cancer that is technically incurable and were I in this situation I wouldn't necessarily bring up the topic and I would leave it to the parents to deal with it after I am gone. However if they asked me about it I would give a pleasant variation of the truth - something that a child or young person could easily process or digest. Something hopeful and loving.,41
15,RenzelW,My wife is currently dying of brain cancer with no window of time remaining outside of “probably not gonna see 2025.” She’s elected to record videos for the little ones in the family to explain who she was and what her life was like and her illness and what happened. She’s left strict instructions not to give it to them until they’re old enough to understand and she said that the last time she says goodbye she’s just going to tell them she’ll see them later. (We’re religious so “see you later” to her is a sneaky way of saying she can see them in heaven),65
16,TrustedNotBelieved,"You have to do the audio and it's played in your funeral. ""Hey, it's dark in here. Hello! Who put me in here, was it you."" There are few funny vid in youtube. 😜",16
17,USBlues2020,Definitely writing ✍️ letters for when they are older and can understand it better,9
18,bikerkon,"Like the others have said, letters and videos are excellent ideas! Have multiple drafts and review them before deciding on the final version. Depending on your state of mind at the time you write/record, the tone may be too sombre or dark, and that may not be the way you'd want to be remembered. It's entirely your choice, though. I wish and pray for the best for you and your family.",39
19,cornteahasnoname,"My first niece was born a month ago. I don’t know for sure how long I have left, but she will likely not remember me. I’ve thought a lot about how to tell her how much I love her and what she means to me, even though she’ll never know me. My brother and SIL have been building her a little library that they hope to add to over the years, so I’ve been buying some of my favorite books and writing notes to her on the inside cover. Sometimes they are super heartfelt and serious, and sometimes they are silly and fun. Sometimes they are about how that book made me feel when I read it, and asking her what she thinks about it. I know it’s probably harder for you to say goodbye to older children who already know you, but maybe a little something that means a lot to you (like books do to me) with a handwritten note that they can always look back on would be nice. I wish you peace and comfort in your days ahead ❤️",96
20,drainbance,I think writing them letters that they can read in the future would be highly appreciated by them,11
21,emmyjane03,"If you’re feeling up to it, go and have a fun day with them. Go to a theme park or a movie and spend too much money on the stupid claw machine. From there, leave a video or a letter that they can look back on and remember how loved they were by you ❤️",27
22,erinmarie777,"I think it’s important to be honest with them. We need to do more in this culture to make dying and death a more normal part of living and a more normal part of our conversations. But maybe also explain that it’s rare for someone to die young, explaining most people are old when they die, so they will probably live until they are very old. I think I would want to give them a little stuffed animal to keep, and make them a video or write a letter for when they are older.",50
23,eurhah,"I'm going through this with both my parents (stave IV lung/breast ... bad time to be us genetically). I would let their parents guide you. If you are very close to them and see them often this will be something the parents need to talk to their kids about almost daily. A 7 year old gets that something is no longer there, a 3-4 year old does not. You're not going to say anything wrong, they will get upset at the idea you will not be ""there"" or that they will not see you. They're going to miss you, that's all they understand.",52
24,fox-lover,Make them videos so they can hear your voice.,6
25,jackhandy2B,"Came here to say exactly this. Meanwhile, just love them now and answer questions honestly. Best you can do, really.",12
26,kiwi1327,I don’t have advice but just wanted to say that I’m so very sorry that you have to even ask this question and that you’re going through this.,15
27,steviestorms,Explain the situation honestly and I think it's important to let them know it doesn't change who you are or your relationships with them. It may or may not take them a while to process but I think this will less likely to scare them or give them abandonment issues.,26
28,stnrgrl10,"I don't have any advice, but I'm praying for you",7
29,sunrayevening,"This list from Wonders and Worries may have some ideas in the books. I think letters are great. I’ve also heard of someone sending flowers every year on a daughter’s birthday, they paid in advance with a florist.",28
30,tamaith,"Cards and letters is a great idea. Another idea is recording videos, putting them on youtube in addition to keeping a hard copy to give the parents. If you don't know what to say read a book (for bedtime) or something with a personal message of what you want to say.An inexpensive tablet would be perfect to record and store the videos, upload them to keep them safe in the future.",41
31,zaratheclown,"this is absolutely beautiful! your wife sounds like a gem of a person i’ve heard of someone who did this with their nieces but in addition, they gave some jewellery so that they can wear it when they ‘see them later’",21
