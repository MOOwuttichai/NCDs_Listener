drainbance,I think writing them letters that they can read in the future would be highly appreciated by them,107
jackhandy2B,"Came here to say exactly this. Meanwhile, just love them now and answer questions honestly. Best you can do, really.",126
Low-Future9354,This does sounds like a great idea. I feel like I'd be a mess if I tried to say a real goodbye in person!,115
GeneralTonight2401,Even a video to add with it would be nice,51
RenzelW,My wife is currently dying of brain cancer with no window of time remaining outside of “probably not gonna see 2025.” She’s elected to record videos for the little ones in the family to explain who she was and what her life was like and her illness and what happened. She’s left strict instructions not to give it to them until they’re old enough to understand and she said that the last time she says goodbye she’s just going to tell them she’ll see them later. (We’re religious so “see you later” to her is a sneaky way of saying she can see them in heaven),583
Low-Future9354,Videos are honestly a great idea. I didn't even think of videos. They could rewatch it as often as they wanted. Thanks so much for this idea. Thoughts are with you and your wife also 💚,194
zaratheclown,"this is absolutely beautiful! your wife sounds like a gem of a person i’ve heard of someone who did this with their nieces but in addition, they gave some jewellery so that they can wear it when they ‘see them later’",233
PetalumaDr,"Maybe an appropriate modification of Ira Byock’s “5 things” (which started as 4). I l love you, thank you for being part of my life, I forgive you for anything you may regret, please forgive me for anything I did which may have hurt you, I believe in you. Again it depends on the relationship and age but I find those 5 things to be an awesome start.",360
CarinaConstellation,Maybe give them a gift of a framed photo of you and them and a handwritten note so they can keep it. That's what my step mom did when she died.,153
cornteahasnoname,"My first niece was born a month ago. I don’t know for sure how long I have left, but she will likely not remember me. I’ve thought a lot about how to tell her how much I love her and what she means to me, even though she’ll never know me. My brother and SIL have been building her a little library that they hope to add to over the years, so I’ve been buying some of my favorite books and writing notes to her on the inside cover. Sometimes they are super heartfelt and serious, and sometimes they are silly and fun. Sometimes they are about how that book made me feel when I read it, and asking her what she thinks about it. I know it’s probably harder for you to say goodbye to older children who already know you, but maybe a little something that means a lot to you (like books do to me) with a handwritten note that they can always look back on would be nice. I wish you peace and comfort in your days ahead ❤️",925

tamaith,"Cards and letters is a great idea. Another idea is recording videos, putting them on youtube in addition to keeping a hard copy to give the parents. If you don't know what to say read a book (for bedtime) or something with a personal message of what you want to say.An inexpensive tablet would be perfect to record and store the videos, upload them to keep them safe in the future.",391
Basic_Government_730,"I was around that age when my sister passed from leukemia and we didn’t really have proper goodbyes but she left a voicemail of her singing me happy birthday (a few days before she died) and I listened to it all the time growing up. It got deleted when I moved out and it is gutting me even typing about it now. I was a weird kid so once I knew what she had I wanted to know everything I could about it, so I knew she’d be dying. I found having clear and objective information about the illness really helped me but that could just be the autism lol.",560
fox-lover,Make them videos so they can hear your voice.,55
PyewacketPonsonby,I have stage 4 cancer that is technically incurable and were I in this situation I wouldn't necessarily bring up the topic and I would leave it to the parents to deal with it after I am gone. However if they asked me about it I would give a pleasant variation of the truth - something that a child or young person could easily process or digest. Something hopeful and loving.,392
kiwi1327,I don’t have advice but just wanted to say that I’m so very sorry that you have to even ask this question and that you’re going through this.,151
erinmarie777,"I think it’s important to be honest with them. We need to do more in this culture to make dying and death a more normal part of living and a more normal part of our conversations. But maybe also explain that it’s rare for someone to die young, explaining most people are old when they die, so they will probably live until they are very old. I think I would want to give them a little stuffed animal to keep, and make them a video or write a letter for when they are older.",484
Plastic_Leg_3812,I agree with writing them a little message along with any photos you may have of yourself with them. They will cherish it. I mostly just wanted to say you sound like a wonderful person for caring so much about their feelings. I’m so sorry you are going through this.,276
HistoricalFishing2,"Video cards , letters, maybe even a little teddy bear from build a bear and record a message for them to play back whenever they’d like? My thoughts are with you! 🙏🏼",175
TrustedNotBelieved,"You have to do the audio and it's played in your funeral. ""Hey, it's dark in here. Hello! Who put me in here, was it you."" There are few funny vid in youtube. 😜",177
