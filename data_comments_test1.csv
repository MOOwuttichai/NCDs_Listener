    If you really want help and guidance, you‚Äôd need to share what type of cancer you have and what your doctors are recommending for your initial treatment.

    I'm always going to advise treatment. It isn't as bad as you fear and not getting treated could be far worse.
  
    Talk with your oncologist. I am stage 4 large cell LC. Been NED for 4 years. Don't give up until you try. You can always say STOP. And they will.
  
    Good luck

    I'm 4 tnbc metastatic and have been since at least the end of 2021, discovered 2022.  Had IBC in 2019 before that.
  
    I've only had traditional treatment, so I can only recommend that.  I've done well with it, and it is NOT the depiction shown on TV.  At least for me.
  
    I agree with Professional-Age.  Talk to your oncologist.  Try a few things until or unless you want to stop.

    Stage IV cancer is not necessarily a death sentence. While some cancers are essentially incurable at this stage, many others are not.¬†
  
    You will have to have an honest conversation with your oncologist and yourself. For your oncologist, what is the prognosis? Treatment? Post-treatment outlook? For you, depending on the prognosis, what is more important: quality of life or quantity of life? What quality/quantity do you get with accepting or refusing treatment?
  
    You would not dumb for accepting or refusing treatment. Accepting treatment is fine, even with a poor prognosis. It is your right to fight. At the same time, it is fine to refuse treatment. It does not mean you are a quitter or weak. It is a deeply personal choice and no one has the right to make you feel bad for it.
  
    Also, you can start treatment and end it at any time.¬†
  
    Either way, I recommend a palliative care consult. It is always nice to have them on board to help manage potential symptoms. Your oncologist should also have additional resources that may be more specific to your cancer diagnosis as well.¬†

    Ive been told I had 16 months. Twice.  Last time was 2 years ago.
  
    Chemotherapy is tough. As are the surgeries. But. Its been worth it to me so far. 3 surgeries, and 27 folfox or folfirri rounds later. If you can enjoy the non suffering periods, and are survival oriented it's very doable.
  
    Also, zofram.  For real. I love that drug. And my cat.

    My wife recently diagnosed with stage 4. Had our second rd of chemo yesterday. Why not fight? Why not try to get more years? Its not a death sentence. You get into remission, they could have any kind of medical breakthrough in the next few years.

    I'm stage 4 sarcoma, diagnosed January 2015, wasn't expected to live more than a few years but I continued treatments. Every time one stopped working then a new trial was always available. At this point they can't say for sure what my prognosis is because I'm still fighting it, but it's slowed down to the point I could have potentially YEARS and YEARS. Stage 4 is scary af but it isn't a death sentence until they tell you it is.

    If you need to hear from someone who has had your specific diagnosis Imerman Angels is worth checking out. Only thing is it could take a while :(I offer my support too if you'd like <3 I had a stage 4 tumor and survived through much treatment. My situation is somewhat chaotic though, so idk maybe that would be stressful  to hear about. Regardless, I hope that you can find some peace soon friend, I know the wave of emotions and doubt sucks.

    Stage 4b here, NED 2 years. My treatment was not agonizing or what I would call painful.  Suffering was not really what I experienced either. Granted chemo has its own brand of suffering but I tolerated it just fine.

    I understand your you being confused and overwhelmed with emoticons, but you need to find the strenght to fight  the Beast anyway. Undertaking therapy will give you a chance, without therapy there Is no chance! On one side there are no 2 people that react to therapy in the same way, so It may not even be that bad. There are so many chemotherapy drugs combination that It Is impossible to say how your body will react. Also the body may  react different with each cycle. This Is what Is happening to me right now, for instance, and my body Is tollerating chemo slightly better each cycle. Second thing you must consider, but which Is actually the most important One, and s that your mindset Is sooo important. Sheer will to fight and survive can keep you going. Once again from personal experience, a positive attitude kept my mom going for 10 years (the doctors said  2 gruelling years at the most)  and through nine long chemo cycles, 5 of which experimental, countless radio therapy cycles and 3 surgeries and that was in the mid 90s. She wanted to live for me and my dad and kept fighting. I'm following her example, fighting for myself and my family, trying to keep a positive attitude and seeking help when I falter. Seek counceling, they can provide you with the ""tools"" you need to fight your battle, or they may even just make you realised you already have them in you. Pick up the fight, dont let the Beast get to you easly!

    Chemo can be miserable. It can make you feel tired and nauseous. But the pain of out of control cancer is terrible. I‚Äôm stage IV as well and when my cancer progresses it hurts like hell, especially when it‚Äôs in my bones. So when you say that one choice is more painful and agonizing I agree. Letting the cancer just run rampant with no treatment is more painful and agonizing than any chemo I‚Äôve had.

    You are asking important and difficult questions.  Only you can determine whether the trade-offs of treatment are worth it to you, and you can't truly know if the trade-offs are worth it until you try. Your fear of suffering from the treatment may be way overblown as others have already suggested (and your Oncologist will have a plan b and plan c if the treatment is worse than the disease with plan a).
  
    We are all going to die and we are all going to suffer before we die-that is the deal the day we are born.  The suffering that comes with cancer growth that is unchecked can be significant, so framing it as suffering vs non-suffering may not be the best lens to view your choice through. Keeping the cancer growth in check can lead to less suffering despite side effects.
  
    Many people have no evidence of disease 5 years after treatment of certain stage 4 cancers so talking with your team about median survival and 5 year survival for your specific situation might also be helpful.
  
    This last year with my terminal diagnosis and the side effects of radiation, chemo, and immuno therapy has been one of the best times of my life as I have grown closer to my family and friends, and I have felt a sense of gratitude for my life which I was unable to feel when my lifespan was longer.  My strong recommendation is not to deny yourself the chance of living one the the most meaningful years of your life whichever path you choose- choose gratitude over fear.

    Stage IV Ovarian cancer, feel free to reach out to me too if you have any questions or a similar diagnosis.
  
    My coping method has and always will be downplaying (don‚Äôt do that) and making things into jokes. It works for the most part to make the people around I care about not so stressed or panicked, but please. Remember to acknowledge any limits you develop from treatment. Be honest with yourself and your doctor.

    I'm stage 4 with what should be considered a death sentence(or used to be). Yeah I have bad days, today being one of them but treatment wasn't even a question. And since I've been on it I've had some improvement.
  
    I can tell you the initial shock and what I've referred to as self grieving will pass.
  
    Also I'm not sure what cancer type you have and that would be a good start. I bet you can find someone on here in a very short amount of time that has the same or similar so as to get an idea of what treatment would be like.

    There is a balance they can find with your treatment. You may have a rough few days then a good two weeks. Try it even if it‚Äôs bad at first stick with it.they can make adjustments . I am sorry you are going through this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

    I am young with stage 4 and am in chemo treatments that are working. I know it‚Äôs scary but I advise you give treatment a shot. The doctors I have do everything they can can to minimize side effects you just have to communicate with them. You can always stop treatment if it‚Äôs awful but chemo reduced my ascites and shitty symptoms I had leading up to diagnose and I find the symptoms of chemo a lot more manageable than my progressing cancer that was on it‚Äôs way to kill me. Please make an informed decision before you ruin your chances at living.

    Some late stage metastatic cancers are curable; others manageable like a chronic disease.  I‚Äôm cancer free of metastatic cancer for 12 years.  Take the treatment.  I will always say ‚Äútake the treatment‚Äù.  It‚Äôs the only chance you have to be cured and/or live longer.

    When you first get diagnosed is the most scary! I have stage 4 diagnosed in Jan 2022 and I just got a clear PET scan which means no active cancer. Mine spread over my whole skeleton. Sometimes, I rationale that I know how I'll lilwt die (barring tragic accident) most people don't. There are new treatments coming out all the time and I can stop any treatment whenever I want. Every has a different journey.

    This is easy OP. Go for the treatment - that is the right decision I promise. I remember feeling the same way at the beginning. But with treatment you have 50/50 odds and without you will most certainly die sooner. You have got to at least try. If you‚Äôre in the US, you will be assigned a care team with at least one nurse you can go to anytime with questions or support. They will tell you, you can stop anytime. You will be treated with kid gloves like the precious human you are. You will be given everything you want or need within their power to do so. I was quite spoiled by my nurses during my treatment and recovery and honestly it‚Äôs funnily something I miss about having cancer. Ask me anything!

    Just my two cents: my mother was stage IV with a very aggressive cancer and she opted to go for treatment and she has been in remission for over a year now. Treatment, when offered as a viable option, should in my opinion always be considered

    I progressed to stage IV lymphoma and I‚Äôm cured now. Treatments can help from attempting to cure or even just treating the symptoms. It‚Äôs hard to guide you when you don‚Äôt disclose the type of cancer and what the overall plan your oncologist(s) have for you.

    I understand your concerns. I was sure I was not going through the hell of treatments last year when I was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. Until I went to MDAnderson in Houston and had the absolute blessing of speaking to my very optimistic oncologist who gave me so much hope. I went through 6 months of chemo and immunotherapy and now am only doing immunotherapy. It‚Äôs not a picnic and some days are worse than others but now I am almost side effect free and enjoying life. i had 29 brain tumors that are now gone and my 7.6 cm lung tumor is now 1.6 cm and inactive. i pray you will make the best decision for yourself and go bravely forward!
