4,1LungWonder,"18 years post-treatment... every day I have some issue related to surgery or treatment.. teeth are horrible, extensive nerve damage due to radiation, not to mention breathing issues due to losing a lung. My doctor actually said to me ""Be happy you're alive! Most people don't make it."" It's not that I'm not happy, I would like a better quality of life. I have good days, great days, and not so good days. I take things one day at a time. I'm very happy to still be alive, yes.. but I guess I'm chronically ill and in pain.. it is what it is I guess.Does your psychologist understand post-cancer trauma and PTSD? Survivorship is a shit show.. I want you to know it's totally understandable and normal. Everyone around us expects us to be happy and positive and living every moment to its fullest, when in actuality getting up in the morning is a struggle. Finding people who understand can help, finding a support group or therapist who gets it is vital. I'm going on 19 years... I promise it does get better.. is it back to what it was pre-cancer? No, but it can be a good life despite all you've been through. Please be kind to yourself and give yourself grace... please feel free to reach out if you ever need a sympathetic ear. I'm happy to listen.I celebrate the day I had my surgery to have my lung removed. We call it ""Lungleavin' Day"" the day my lung left... We celebrate by writing our fears on a plate and smashing the plate in a bonfire. We started sharing the occasion with friends and family and it grew to become a really incredible celebration. We used it for a fundraiser for mesothelioma, the cancer I lost my lung to.. Up until the pandemic... 2020 was our last party.. My husband, son and I still smashed plates every year though.. We are going to start back up in 2025 again.. it feels like a good time to celebrate. February 2nd.. for most people its Groundhog's Day.. for us? It's Lungleavin Day :)",215,0,0,"['start', '18', 'years', 'posttreatment', 'every', 'day', 'i', 'issue', 'related', 'surgery', 'treatment', 'teeth', 'horrible', 'extensive', 'nerve', 'damage', 'due', 'radiation', 'mention', 'breathing', 'issues', 'due', 'losing', 'lung', 'my', 'doctor', 'actually', 'said', 'be', 'happy', 'youre', 'alive', 'most', 'people', 'dont', 'make', 'its', 'im', 'happy', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'better', 'quality', 'life', 'i', 'good', 'days', 'great', 'days', 'good', 'days', 'i', 'take', 'things', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'im', 'happy', 'still', 'alive', 'yes', 'i', 'guess', 'im', 'chronically', 'ill', 'pain', 'i', 'guessdoes', 'psychologist', 'understand', 'postcancer', 'trauma', 'ptsd', 'survivorship', 'shit', 'show', 'i', 'want', 'know', 'totally', 'understandable', 'normal', 'everyone', 'around', 'us', 'expects', 'us', 'happy', 'positive', 'living', 'every', 'moment', 'fullest', 'actuality', 'getting', 'morning', 'struggle', 'finding', 'people', 'understand', 'help', 'finding', 'support', 'group', 'therapist', 'gets', 'vital', 'im', 'going', '19', 'years', 'i', 'promise', 'get', 'better', 'back', 'precancer', 'no', 'good', 'life', 'despite', 'youve', 'please', 'kind', 'give', 'grace', 'please', 'feel', 'free', 'reach', 'ever', 'need', 'sympathetic', 'ear', 'im', 'happy', 'listeni', 'celebrate', 'day', 'i', 'surgery', 'lung', 'removed', 'we', 'call', 'lungleavin', 'day', 'day', 'lung', 'left', 'we', 'celebrate', 'writing', 'fears', 'plate', 'smashing', 'plate', 'bonfire', 'we', 'started', 'sharing', 'occasion', 'friends', 'family', 'grew', 'become', 'really', 'incredible', 'celebration', 'we', 'used', 'fundraiser', 'mesothelioma', 'cancer', 'i', 'lost', 'lung', 'up', 'pandemic', '2020', 'last', 'party', 'my', 'husband', 'son', 'i', 'still', 'smashed', 'plates', 'every', 'year', 'though', 'we', 'going', 'start', 'back', '2025', 'feels', 'like', 'good', 'time', 'celebrate', 'february', '2nd', 'people', 'groundhogs', 'day', 'us', 'its', 'lungleavin', 'day', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Radiation Therapy']",Unable to specify

35,Affectionate_Bid1548,"Lost my aunt two weeks ago to lung cancer that metastasised to her breast, rib and spine. She was paralysed from waist down. She was diagnosed 5 days after initial paralysis after A&E sent her home to be literally carries/dragged by her son and daughter. I understand the heartache and anger all too well. She had asked her Dr, A&E and Out of hours for an X-ray in January because she was in excruciating pain and all three of them turned her away. Three months later she was paralysed from the waist down and non even three months after that she passed. Treatment wise there was nothing they could do, radiotherapy didn’t work and as she was immobile chemo wasn’t an option. She was in palliative care at home but had to spend almost two weeks in hospital after catching covid, e-coli in her urine etc. The Saturday before she passed she was taken into hospital by ambulance, the Dr wanted to keep her in but she wanted to go home so we took her home. She passed a week later at home surrounded by her loved ones. If your mum wants home take her home! If the hospital can’t help then there’s no need for her to be there. This disease is absolutely horrific and declines happen suddenly and quickly. Cherish every moment. We were told to expect between 4-6 months and she only lived four weeks. A few hours before she passed we were told another few days and she passed within hours. From what I’m reading, your mums condition is declining pretty quickly and it may be time to start closing the chapter. I know it’s so hard and I’m so so sorry you’re going through this. If you want someone to speak to a bit further, don’t hesitate to reach out.

53,Anon-567890,"💔💔😭😭What country are you in? Can you switch to a different cancer center?You guys can always get a second opinion as there is lots to considerGosh, I’m so sorry to hear this. I know how awful you all must feel! This is such a shock. It is so difficult being patient through the complete diagnostic process. They will test his biopsy for mutation markers and PD-L1 which will guide the oncology team in forming a treatment plan, whether targeted therapy if he has certain markers to immunotherapy with adequate PD-L1. There could be chemo or radiation in the mix. Those alternative options are not something I’d focus on. Stem cell therapy is only in clinical trials. You should have access to excellent oncologists in the Seattle area. Listen to them as they form a treatment plan. I wish you all the best. Keep us updated! (I’m 9 years out from a Stage IV adenocarcinoma diagnosis with 6 recurrences, just FYI.)Great answer and may I just add that staying hydrated is of utmost importance? I drink tons of water in the first few days to flush out toxins. I’m lucky I love water and drink it exclusively, and always have “my emotional support water bottle” right by my side always! 🤣What country are you in? You should have regular appointments with your oncologist. When does chemo begin?I lived clean. Never smoked, ate right, worked out regularly. When I got diagnosed with stage IV adeno my oncologist said it’s becoming more common in female non-smokers and they don’t know why. I quit asking because it doesn’t serve me to ask. By the way, that was 9 years ago. Focus on treatment and maintaining health! Sorry you’re here in this sub and your mom is lucky to have you! We are here for youThis good news makes us all happy! 🤍🤍🤍You get in a “chemo rhythm.” First one it’s hard to know what to expect. And everyone’s side effects will be different, so keeping a chemo journal will allow her to know that, maybe, by day 5 she can walk more, or by day 10 she gets her appetite back (whatever her side effects are). That way she can kind of know what to expect each round. I was always able to work the day after (probably because all those steroids), but by Saturday evening the “darkness” descended. But always know there is light after the darkness. Always! Hope she tolerates everything with as few side effects as possible! 🤍🤍You are a warrior! Thank you for advancing the science!!I’d get a second, maybe third opinions from oncologists.Thank you for your kind words! I’m grateful that your mother is doing so well after her brain surgery! I’ve never dealt with that yet. I’m glad the timing of posting my story helped you! Please share my story of hope with your mom!! Hugs! 🤍🤍Thank YOU for all you do for all of us here! 🤍Thanks to the anonymous Kind Redditor for the award! 🥰🤍🥰🤍I felt lymph nodes on the left side of my neck. No other symptoms. Already stage IV at diagnosis. So surgery wasn’t on the table.I hope you get good results from the chemo. No fun, and it’s difficult to focus on the good when all seems bad, but I’ve been lucky to be in the light after the darkness! I wish you the best! We are here for you! 🤍🤍🤍Thank you for these kind words! Been on the struggle bus this week because I haven’t had chemo in so long and I kinda forgot what a challenge it is!

59,Arsenicandtea,"I don't have cancer, honestly not sure why this was a notification, but as a mom I wanted to respond to you. As parents there's this deep pain at the thought of our children dying. They've been spending years fighting to keep that pain away. It's honestly selfish because they're causing you pain so they don't have to have pain. Here's my suggestion, say to them ""Mom, dad, I know you love me. I know you've been fighting hard to have the long life I should have had. I know you want to see me grow and live a long life, I want that too, but that's not the life I am going to have. I can't know how long my life will be but I can decide on the quality of the life I have. What I have to do to keep living doesn't make a life worth living. I am going to stop the chemo and count my life by the quality not the quantity. I want to spend however much time I have left building happy memories with the people I love. There's nothing you can do about me dying, but I hope your last memories of me are happy ones knowing I've had a good life and lived it on my terms. I hope you choose not to spend whatever time I have left fighting me and angry at my decision. I love you both so much."" There's a quote from Dr Who that I like: ""Every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things but vice versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant.""

73,Bama-1970,"I had RATS (Robot Assisted Thoracic Surgery) last December for a 1.2 cm Type 1A pulmonary nodule, which consisted of acinar and lepidic type adenocarcinoma. I had three small incisions below my rib cage on my left side, one for the camera and two for the instruments. They went through my rib cage to perform the surgery, breaking a rib. I spent 2 days in the hospital. I was discharged with OxyContin, but I didn’t have to take it. I took Tylenol for pain. The surgery itself wasn’t bad. My primary complications were atrial flutter and urinary retention from the OxyContin they gave me in the hospital. All the complications were resolved within five weeks after surgery. The surgery isn’t anything to be afraid of. It’s the best chance you have for a cure. The surgery makes you short of breath, so you have to use an Inspirometer for breathing for a while and walk to build up your lung capacity after surgery. They got all my cancer and found no evidence of cancer in my lymph nodes. I have to have CT scans every six months for five years to check for evidence of recurrence. I currently have no evidence of disease with a good chance the cancer won’t recur.Look in to RATS lung cancer surgery. I spent two days in the hospital. No oxygen after surgery.

83,BetterNowThks,"i'm sorry you experienced this reality is this is most of our stories. I suggest filing grievances with all of the related organizations. Like everybody. Writing a letter to the provider doesn't do anything. If they are reported to their governing organizations, that sometimes, sometimes makes a difference. The bottom line is that these doctors are trained to ignore women's pain and discomfort. We are all considered crazy or attention seeking. another way to go would be a lawsuit, but it's such a slog. Definitely file grievances. Wherever you can find something that says ""to file a grievance"" - then do that.You will be ok! I'm 59, hysterectomy in April but the cancer had already burst a fallopian tube and that ovary and spread in the cavity so they took my peritoneum as well. I am on chemo every 4 weeks but in between I am able to do most everything. If you don't have spread, thank your lucky stars! The surgery is a big one but get up as soon as possible and start moving, i promise it helps! You can do this. 💕Rare cancer party. yay. Mine ovarian/fallopian cancer is from my freakin' dna. How do you escape that? I don't think you do, but my mom had ovarian cancer in the 70's and lived cancer-free to her late 80's so in my dreams this thing hits you once and leaves you alone for 3 or 4 decades. Probably not realistic but since almost no one has this RAD51 mutation, mu hopes and dreams seem as valid as what paltry science there is on the topic.Im sorry, and i want you to know that Stage 4 can still mean many years of a good quality of life! The treatments are getting better and better, so try and focus on the plan ahead, and of course you can plan some things for if/when you come to the ens of life. Just think though, people often live longer with Stage 4 than even their doctors thought they could. Live your life. Be a mom, love your spouse, do life between chemo sessions, make those memories...be yourself and live life well. Do rely on friends and family to have your back in the tough moments...Keep talking to us, we are listening! 💕One thing cancer doesn't do? It doesn't heal your narcissistic parents. Disengage from them, and embrace those people who demonstrate their love for you.This is normal for any of us who are or have undergone cancer treatment. I'm in treatment and will have chemo 6 of 6 in 2 weeks, them PARP for 3 years. I agreed to have a little celebration when chemo 6 is over but I have a kind of cancer that is almost guaranteed to return. I will never be the same.I'm doing a morning gratitude journal, and it helps, but the idea that a killer isn't coming for me is unrealistic and I can't live in fantasyland to make my family and friends feel better.

97,BreakfastInfinite116,"My dad does carbo/opdivo & yervoy every 3 weeks. The first treatments are the hardest, in my opinion, because you just don't know what to expect. Once she's gone through a round or two, you'll feel a bit more prepared. Before and after infusions, make sure she drinks a ton of water, clear fluids and electrolytes! If she's cold, sipping warm broth or soup is great. This helps flush out the residual meds and dead cancer cells after treatment, and can help prevent constipation. In our experience, the symptoms tend to be worse if my dad doesn't drink enough hydrating fluids. Try to avoid coffee or caffeine until after the infusions, especially if she doesn't have a port. We learned the hard way that it can make it more difficult to find veins. 😬 The first day or two likely won't be too bad because they'll give anti-nausea meds and steroids. For my dad's treatments, we have what we call the ""Dreaded Day 4"" which is usually when those wear off and he hits a brick wall of aches and fatigue. He now plans his treatments so that by day 3 or 4, he'll have a couple of days off to just rest and nap. Whenever she is feeling well enough try to take her on some walks, even if its only 10 minutes, and do some sort of light weight lifting or stretching. The last thing you really think about is making sure they workout, but it can actually help recovery and maintaining muscle is important during treatment.My understanding is that everyone has circulating cancer cells that the immune system regularly attacks. Cancer develops when, at some point, some of those cells mutate and/or the immune system can no longer kill them. Removing the tumor can be part of the solution and for many people it's enough, but there is a greater chance of a secondary cancer forming somewhere down the road. The thought behind immunotherapy is to ramp up your immune system to be able to kill those cells, but I've seen it go both ways. For some, the side effects are incredibly harsh and for others, not so much. You could also research some natural diet and lifestyle changes to support your body and immune system if you choose not to do keytruda. It's an incredibly tough decision to make, I wish you the best! ❤️",228,0,0,"['start', 'my', 'dad', 'carboopdivo', 'yervoy', 'every', '3', 'weeks', 'the', 'first', 'treatments', 'hardest', 'opinion', 'dont', 'know', 'expect', 'once', 'shes', 'gone', 'round', 'two', 'youll', 'feel', 'bit', 'prepared', 'before', 'infusions', 'make', 'sure', 'drinks', 'ton', 'water', 'clear', 'fluids', 'electrolytes', 'if', 'shes', 'cold', 'sipping', 'warm', 'broth', 'soup', 'great', 'this', 'helps', 'flush', 'residual', 'meds', 'dead', 'cancer', 'cells', 'treatment', 'help', 'prevent', 'constipation', 'in', 'experience', 'symptoms', 'tend', 'worse', 'dad', 'doesnt', 'drink', 'enough', 'hydrating', 'fluids', 'try', 'avoid', 'coffee', 'caffeine', 'infusions', 'especially', 'doesnt', 'port', 'we', 'learned', 'hard', 'way', 'make', 'difficult', 'find', 'veins', '😬', 'the', 'first', 'day', 'two', 'likely', 'wont', 'bad', 'theyll', 'give', 'antinausea', 'meds', 'steroids', 'for', 'dads', 'treatments', 'call', 'dreaded', 'day', '4', 'usually', 'wear', 'hits', 'brick', 'wall', 'aches', 'fatigue', 'he', 'plans', 'treatments', 'day', '3', '4', 'hell', 'couple', 'days', 'rest', 'nap', 'whenever', 'feeling', 'well', 'enough', 'try', 'take', 'walks', 'even', '10', 'minutes', 'sort', 'light', 'weight', 'lifting', 'stretching', 'the', 'last', 'thing', 'really', 'think', 'making', 'sure', 'workout', 'actually', 'help', 'recovery', 'maintaining', 'muscle', 'important', 'treatmentmy', 'understanding', 'everyone', 'circulating', 'cancer', 'cells', 'immune', 'system', 'regularly', 'attacks', 'cancer', 'develops', 'point', 'cells', 'mutate', 'andor', 'immune', 'system', 'longer', 'kill', 'removing', 'tumor', 'part', 'solution', 'many', 'people', 'enough', 'greater', 'chance', 'secondary', 'cancer', 'forming', 'somewhere', 'road', 'the', 'thought', 'behind', 'immunotherapy', 'ramp', 'immune', 'system', 'able', 'kill', 'cells', 'ive', 'seen', 'go', 'ways', 'for', 'side', 'effects', 'incredibly', 'harsh', 'others', 'much', 'you', 'could', 'also', 'research', 'natural', 'diet', 'lifestyle', 'changes', 'support', 'body', 'immune', 'system', 'choose', 'keytruda', 'its', 'incredibly', 'tough', 'decision', 'make', 'i', 'wish', 'best', '❤️', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,"['chronic constipation', 'pain', 'body aches', 'fatigue']",0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,['Unable to specify'],Unable to specify
113,CartographyWho,"Around the world, it seems that women in pain are not taken seriously. As told by someone earlier here, rectal cancer apparently doesn't get diagnosed in younger women because GP's go on the haemorrhoids and IBS route rather than getting a colonoscopy done. That's how most rectal cancers only get diagnosed when they're at stage IV already. I find it unacceptable that women get shipped off with a prescription for Preparation H and dietary or lifestyle advice, when we know that's not what's going on. When I finally got a colonoscopy, I was lucky to only have a large benign tumour in my rectum. Which was then removed and confirmed non cancerous. And I will need to have another colonoscopy in two years. Cancer sucks in all its forms. Some are more prevalent and should be caught earlier to give us a fighting chance. Sorry for ranting as this sort of story hits close to home and really gets me angry with our healthcare systems worldwide. Wishing everyone here a good day 😊You must have lost your way.

Sending you big hugs 🫂 and light ✨️🪷Congratulations 🎊 Really happy for you 😊Hi, I gather from your post and comments that you have TNBC. There's another sub r/breastcancer where we hang out. Come join us, we're a very supportive and smart crowd. Either way, others here have given the best advice.

114,Caseyleehs,"I had low iron, a serverly swollen stomach for about a month or so, pain (like period pain), I couldn’t get rid of it even with the hot water bottle and pills. I ended up burning my stomach with the hot water bottle right before I found out. I thought it was endo because it was all down in that area. Oh and from the swollen belly, I couldn’t eat or drink anything much either. I ended up taking myself to the ER cause I knew at the very least I’d be dehydrated. They suspected ovarian cancer but once I had surgery to take out my extremely big ovaries (both sides were so big they couldn’t even tell which was left and which was right on ultrasound) they found out it started in my colon and spread to ovaries. So lost both ovaries and about 12cm of my colon. It was a bit of a shock but I didn’t have many symptoms tbh. I didn’t think it was cancer at all, I really thought I had a reproductive issue like endo or PCOS.31. Diagnosed with colon cancer stage 4 this May.31 and was diagnosed this year.

145,Constantlearner01,"Well said. I am going to try that “travel if you feel good” since we had to cancel 3 trips with my diagnosis last December. I wonder if my fear of flying has gone away. Will test it out.Well said. I am trying to return to a normal pre-cancer life but struggling with side effects of the chemo maintenance med. I was trying to enjoy a festival yesterday and I was feeling a bit nauseous and GI system out of whack so I can never feel real joy lately. I went to this same festival a year ago before diagnosis and it brought me so much joy. The pictures people took yesterday just remind me of how I was struggling to keep up with them.Sometimes I feel like the realization of the mortality sits on the headboard, waiting patiently and when I wake up, jumps from the headboard to my shoulders and then I say “oh yeah, that’s right, I have this cancer with extremely high rates of recurrence” and realize once again time is limited and this is my world now. When I was first diagnosed, people with high survival cancer rates would say “You Got This” and “I Got Through This and So Will You.” But then you realize not all cancer is the same and some cancers haven’t had much research progress in 40 years!This thread is exactly why I tell people I relate more to reddit as a support group than any other outlet. Who knows more about the situation than people in my exact predicament? I finished my chemo last month and found out that is exactly when the depression hits. Most of us were in shock at diagnosis, then made plans for chemo and surgery and by the time that chemo ends, it catches up to us. You have time to breathe and wonder what the hell just happened? I reached out to the cancer clinic psychologist and had a couple appointments so far. I told her that the appointment should’ve been recommended the minute I was diagnosed. I am also disappointed about all the cancer groups that seem to accept donations but have a hard time finding the people they collect for. I didn’t know about many of these groups until after it was all done. One of them reached out to me when I told her my story about diagnosis and she said they have patients talk to med students but it has to be upbeat and positive and there is to be no calling out any medical provider who mishandled or misdiagnosed your cancer. The PARP med seems to be causing depression for me, like a heavy pall. I feel like I’m on the verge of taking a nap every minute of the day. I have two years of this to look forward to.

187,DownWriteCancerous,"Ask your hospital's social worker about options/support groups. There is also the option for nursing-assisted rehab. Basically staying in a hospital hotel while you recover. Its absolutely okay to want an adult or parental figure in these moments. Cancer is terrifying, surgery is scary and painful. Glad to see your kids are going to coming to visit. Community is so important with things like this. Church, friends, support groups, even sewing/hobby groups. For packing, if you're staying in the hospital: pillow (neck pillow or memory foam, soft throw blanket, tooth brush, soft super stretchy sports bra if you wear bras, big loose tshirt or dress, soft socks with grips (the grip is important, the nurses wont let you wear them usually without grip), a little battery or usb fan if you need a fan to sleep, and a comfort item or two. Maybe it's a picture frame of loved ones, or a stuffed animal (I have a weighted dragon that I've taken to every hospital stay). You got this. :)I got ""lucky"" with a very treatable cancer (Hodgkins Lymphoma). 3 years after I go into remission my mother is diagnosed with 2 separate breast cancers and then a neuroendocrine bone cancer. She has so may bone mets that the doctors have no idea how she is alive. I'm sick of people asking her about hospice. She wants to fight. She so desparately wants to hope and fight and keep living. The mets have reached her brain and now she's hospitalized with more pain that any human should have to endure. And she's had such awful care that she's gaslit herself. What is a 10 to someone who has experienced Hell for 2 years? I had to argue with the doctors and with her that no, she was not at an 8. Mom if your pain is so intense it is causing seizures, its a 10. It sucks and its hard and there is so little support.Stage 3 Hodgkin's Lymphoma survivor here! The ABVD is wild.

197,Dying4aCure,"Is that what my purple power ranger port looks like? Congrats!❤️If you have estrogen positive breast cancer the estrogen blockers can make you quite depressed. Many of us needed anti depressants until our bodies got used to lack of estrogen. Also a good therapist may help if you are not on estrogen blockers. It will probably help if you are! This is all normal. Your body has been through a lot.Hugs. State 4 Breast Cancer here since 2016. I was given three years. These drugs make us depressed. The advice to try an antidepressant is a good one. It is your choice, but doing chemo when the pain got terrible was way better than going through the pain. All of it is palliative, anyway. Be comfortable. Do whatever suits you, but be sure what you are looking at. I don't think I will do more chemo, but if I choose not to, I won’t be telling my family it is an option. Visit us at r/LivingWithMBC we get it. ❤️Come on over to r/LivingWithMBC. I am eight years from diagnosis. Bones, Chest Wall, Lungs and Liver. There are people 40 years out. Not a huge amount, but enough. ❤️❤️❤️Hugs. You didn't say what kind of cancer, but many of these drugs cause depression. Chemical imbalance depression. I humbly suggest you see if there is a chemical imbalance before you make decisions. I was on Zoloft for four years. I was also severely depressed after a hard chemo. By the time an appointment became available, I was fine again. You do you; you have every right. I have been doing this for eight years now. I am glad I sought help. You may be, too—big hugs.

First biopsy was inconclusive and did another one in my lung and also did biomarker. I had ros 1 biomarkers and a candidate for target therapy. Had spine surgery on Christmas Eve. Started target therapy on Jan 11. Now I am pretty much back to my old self. In January before target therapy my weight was 130lbs now I am back to 190lbs and working out 4 times a week.

For the month of June, it was only watermelon and protein shakes. Now I can’t do either of those and went from watermelon to pickles and that was short lived. I went from that to popcorn and now I have no foods that I am like, I want to eat that. Toast is okay, but once I feel it has too much butter on it, I am done.

209,Egoy,"Sudden intense pain in my lower back right side that radiated down to my testicles. Hurt so much I threw up. I presumed a kidney stone (never had one) I went to urgent care and they gave me an X-ray and saw a very tiny stone. They gave me a prescription for a med that makes passing stones easier, and a strainer and told me to come back in a week if I hadn’t passed the stone. I didn’t pass a stone and went back, they gave me a CT scan and that’s when they knew. The ER doctor told me I don’t have a kidney stone and made a phone call to the urologist right in front of me and told him he was sending a file to him and he needed to look at it asap. That’s when I knew. Several cats and an mri later I was scheduled to have the kidney removed. No biopsy prior because the kidney was done for anyway. The real surprise was when the pathology on the kidney came back for Ewing’s instead of renal cell carcinoma.That sucks OP. It’s perfectly natural to fear chemo and radiation but if your fear is based on what you knew about them a decade ago things are better now than they were. I suggest a very honest discussion with your care team about your fears. Give them a chance to explain everything to you based on what patients are experiencing with your treatment plan today. It’s not pleasant (done them both myself) but there is a lot of things available to you that can help protect your health tissue and keep you safer and more comfortable during treatment.

213,Electronic-Ad-4000,"The day I was cancer freeYea everyone has a different experience even if it is the same cancer/treatmentEvery time I try to agree to disagree he still wants to argue, damned if I do damned if I don't. I'd rather die than go through that again.. I don't have the strength anymore Relatable! But you are alive. You have to reset your expectations of yourself. Find your new norm. Chemo brain sucks yeah.. you'll learn to adjust your life around it. That's the thing... I don't wanna be alive but I don't exactly have a choice. I found my new self a couple months ago well I guess I still am and I'm learning my limits with a lot of things. Thx for the advice!The same thing is happening to me (also 17) but with my great grandma. She's constantly asking me if I ate and what I ate. Then when I tell her I already ate she argues that I didn't because she didn't see me eat. She sleeps all day so by the time she's getting up I'm going to sleep so how the hell does she know if I ate or not. She's always saying I need to eat healthier in case the cancer comes back. Who in their right mind would say that to a cancer survivor. And the thing is I do eat healthy but sometimes I'll eat snacks after a meal or get a pizza for dinner. And even when I go out with my Dad she'll say it's cold out there I need a jacket or it's too hot to be outside today. I LOOK AT THE WEATHER EVERY SINGLE TIME BEFORE I LEAVE THE HOUSE, I PLAN MY OUTFITS ACCORDING TO THE WEATHER. She never goes outside so she doesn't even know how it feels out there. It's gotten to the point that I don't even talk to her anymore, I ignore her now because I can't stand her opinions. My Dad has told her multiple times that she's too pushy and needs to stop telling me what to do because I can take care of myself. Everyday my Dad will ask me how I'm feeling and if I ate which I don't mind because he's not pushy with it. He doesn't argue with me on it like my great grandma does and the only reason he asks me if I ate is because he'll get me something from the store if I didn't. Anyways I'm moving out very soon because I can't stand the way she treats me, you should move out too if it's affecting your mental health.Maybe you have chemo brain.The thought of getting it again scares me too. You should look into therapy or support groups. Hopefully everything works out for you! If you wanna talk you can pm me I'd be happy to listen.Wow it's nice to know there's someone out there that was in my exact situation and made it out to be happy. Thank you for the advice it really helps. Lately I've just been here, not happy or sad just here and I don't wanna go to therapy because those people won't understand since they've never had cancer so I've been in cancer support groups which help a little bit. Everyone around me is happy I beat cancer and keeps congratulating me which is very annoying. I hate when people do that or even bring it up, I wish people would forget about it. I feel like a completely different person, my mindset has changed, my body has changed, nothing about is the same which is fine. But anyways thank you for responding 😊Everything that you said makes so much sense, you become a different person after almost dying. I too understand how valuable life is and how fast it can be taken away. I see the world differently now. I'm glad you're doing better 💜Yes it'll take a long time to feel back normal again which I'm sad about because I want to be a firefighter and I know that'll hold me back. I've cut a lot of people outta my life from that time. It's just the people I live with that don't understand it's hard for me to talk about that period in my life so they constantly bring it up. I'll be setting boundaries soon though.Thank you for responding to my post because now I know I'm not the only one feeling like this lolThank you those are some very wise wordsI have new hobbies now so that's a start.I don't think anything be will back normal again, I'm currently writing a book about it actually. My symptoms are: My voice has changed it's more scratchy. My toe nails are black my finger nails are back to it's normal color. I'm in constant pain all over my body. My chest hurts where I had surgery (port placement) so I can't wear bras anymore . The worst of it all is the chemo brain, I had to stop studying to become a firefighter because I can't remember anything and can't focus on things for long. And I'm sure I'm missing more but that's all I can't think of right nowEvery cancer survivor knows that when you're physical free you're not mentally and emotionally free. One of the hardest things I'm dealing with right now is my great grandma, she keeps bringing up my cancer anytime she gets. Constantly talking about how it was so hard on me and how my family abandoned me during that time. It's like she's purposely reminding me about the most traumatic experience in my life so that's definitely a trigger. Thank you stranger 💜I was diagnosed with hodgkins lymphoma last year, I'm now cancer free and my doctors said the same thing. ""If there's any cancer to get it would be this one because it's curable"" I've since hated that people say it's the ""good cancer"" because there's no such thing as a good cancer, cancer all around is bad. I don't even feel like I'm cancer free, I'm still in pain and nothing is back to how it used to be before I got sick.I had hodgkins lymphoma at age 17 (last year) and the whole time I didn't process that any day could be my last. Everyone says I'm strong but I'm not all I did was stay alive which is what people do everyone. So I don't see how I'm special. I don't even feel like an survivor because nothing has really changed. I'm still in pain, I'm still weak. Everything has changed. Nothing is how it used to be before I got sick.I plan to get one this year, it'll be my first tattoo",655,0,0,"['start', 'the', 'day', 'i', 'cancer', 'freeyea', 'everyone', 'different', 'experience',

He said her dying words were “No pain.” I think it is up to each person to decide how much pain they can and will endure. I wish you strength and send you love. Here is what Vonnegut wrote: “My only sister, five years older than I, died when she was forty. She was over six feet tall, too, by an angstrom unit or so. She was heavenly to look at, and graceful, both in and out of water. She was a sculptress. She was christened “Alice,” but she used to deny that she was really an Alice. I agreed. Everybody agreed. Sometime in a dream maybe I will find out what her real name was. Her dying words were, “No pain.” Those are good dying words.

257,GameofCheese,"I'm gonna paste something I wrote in a different post. I think it fits here too... Taking control of your quality of life by choosing to end treatments is brave and can make a horrible end a nicer one with less pain, more family, and maybe some last adventures. Choosing to end treatment is just as valid as doing clinical trials and everything else one can do to try to remove the cancer. No one else can tell any of us what we should or shouldn't do. In my case, it was pure luck we caught it earlyish and it was ""very treatable"" with current medicine. But it was also mere chance that I had shoulder/ neck pain that helped find my last tumor behind my facial sinuses. I don't know, if I had gone longer and it hadn't been discovered for many more years, I might have chosen not to ""fight"" and simply enjoy the time I had. We're all different, every case is different, every family is different. No choices are fit for everyone. There is nothing wrong with picking and choosing what actions you want to take on this journey. It's your journey, no one else's. There is a lot of beauty in choosing your final days. Most people never get to do that. As a culture we are terribly naive about medicine and death. I worked in a children's hospital and honestly some of the best gifts a parent can give a child is a gentle passing. There is nothing wrong with that. Medicine can only do so much.

267,GraymaneGent,"51 and out of my last chemo cycle for a month tomorrow, still have to go through surgery next month. I feel like the ghost of my old self, always moving, Always up to something, never caring about akes and pain untill they prevented me to reach my objectives. Now I feel weack, physical fatigue Is the new standard condition, struggling to focus on any mildly complex intellectual task, and scrutinising every new pain and sensation with fear. Here Is when will power needs to kick in, I'm forcing myself to push my limits a little bit (almost) every day. I try to walk longer everyday, may It be just to go to buy bread at the bakery down the road or to the post office etc. Being fortunate enough to be at my parents house in a costal town by the sea for this entire month, I try to swim 5 mitutes longer each day to regain muscle tone and stamina. I force myself to read at least 20 pages of a book every day to regain the ability to focus and do sudoku, crosswords or some kind of puzzle game or build and paint model kits for half and hour to regain problem solving ability and witt. I try to meet with people as often as possible, to regain social skills lost during the long time spent in hospital pitting myself and becoming angry at the entire world. Willpower is everything, things may not go as hoped in the future, but I will noy let every again cancer kill my spirit and witt before it kills my body!Great news, its so encouraging reading about remissione and healing front time to time.

Took an xray of the chest, and saw a mass on right lung. Gave me some morphine which relaxed the BP. Did a CT scan, then a PET scan within a month. Stage IV Lung cancer with mets to brain, ribs and back. Stage II Esophagus cancer which didn't come from the main tumor in lung. Esophagus cancer is gone. Lung cancer is managed.I enjoyed having a rare cancer. I'm a bit of a research geek, and loved watching world leading cancer oncologists marvel at what I have, and how they would treat it. The cancer in itself isn't rare, its the combination which fascinated Mayo Clinic world class researchers. I have Stage IV Lung w Mets to lymph nodes, brain, ribs and back. But the primary lung had nothing to do with my Stage II esophagus cancer. Having two distinct cancers at the same time is quite rare. They could NOT operate on the esophagus as having Stage IV in full blown metastasis mode was not an option. They elected for chemo/radiation on esophagus, while taking targeted therapy for lung. There wasn't much data on how this would effect me, and how to take my targeted therapy pill if I couldn't swallow.

305,ImmediateButton1497,"I’m battling with the decision too. As time goes by, I just get more and more uncomfortable. Whenever I open up to my doctors about it they just normalize it and tell me it’s part of the dying process.

I tried asking family and friends for advice but they always tell me it’s my decision to make and mine only. How and when to make that decision remains completely obscure to me. It is scary. Do we wait until the idea of pain gets scarier than death? Should we do it before and avoid all that miserable painful stuff? I have no idea. I feel like there’s no good answer to this.

307,Impressive_Course_44,"I completely agree with your post. As you mentioned its up to each individual. I liked the “you got this” phrase. My wife and I used it a lot. I was the one with the cancer, and mine was “curable”. To me the phrase was more about surviving the treatments then it was about beating cancer. Like I have to go in every day for proton treatment, as the side effects start to build up, it can be tedious. To me “I/you got this” just simple meant I can get through the 20 mins on the table today and not let it knock me down. However, my best fried recently passed away due to cancer. I never used that phrase with him. I let him lead the way in how we discussed his cancer. He was the most positive guy you would have ever met. He faced his condition with a smile on his face, knowing that he only had a few months to a couple of years at best. Luckily he survived more in the year and a half or so range with a great quality of life all for except the last couple of weeks. However, he was very careful on how he spoke about his cancer and his future. You could tell he was positive but not hopeful.Funny, as I was reading this, my first thought was before I even saw my onc, they had a palliative care appointment on my calendar. After my first onc visit they canceled it as they felt it was not really time to bring them in, but they were keenly aware that at some point they may be needed and were proactive about it.

We have been working on managing the pain they have gotten me a bed I can sleep in they offer to speak to me about my feelings they have got me home health. I should and everyone should be offered these services. I have been blessed with an amazing palliative care team! I also felt like a burden to my children and they have released these feelings and emotions. My children are also angels to me! Please don’t hesitate to ask for anything from your doctors for palliative care totally changes everything for you!!!Please please get the testing done. I’m incurable and going to pass away soon I made or asked all my children to go do the genetic testing. I did it 10 years ago and was negative but my daughters was not. I also lost my job even though they let me work remotely when I broke my leg and ankle on the job. Now they are begging me to come back to work remotely because they can’t find anyone else to do the job as well as I did their words not mine! Of course it could be something to do with being sued for not offering FMLA to a cancer patient etc. I couldn’t do the job now anyways due to the severe pain and sickness etc of this cancer.

413,Marta_Smarta,"I wasn't taken seriously either. My family doctor kept telling me my severe vaginal bleeding/clotting was hormonal, or IUD related. She would say my pap smears are fine so the pain and bleeding was just normal. When I say bleeding, I mean out of nowhere it would gush out and I'd need a complete change of clothes from the waist down. This went on for about a year when I was put under to ""find"" the missing IUD. Surgeon found cervical cancer tumor which he biopsied. I was staged 2B. Went through the radiation, chemo, and internal radiation (barbaric, actually). I don't think the tumor ever died but doctors kept telling me MRI was just picking up necrotic tissue. This was in 2019. In 2023 I was getting very short of breath. I told my oncologist about that and he said, there's no way it's cancer spread but if I feel better, I can go down and get an X-ray. Results came in, tumor pushing on lung, now collapsed lung. Also paralyzed my vocal chords because the phrenic nerve was being pressed for too long. Now I'm stage 4B because the cervical cancer metastasized. Went through a gruelling year of treatments that only kept the tumor stable. Now just on immunotherapy and targeted therapy, which is also giving bad side effects. Doctors are very quick to dismiss patients.

419,Melwaukee17,"Hey! Welcome to the really awful club. I don’t live in the same state as my mom, and I’ve been flying in for every round of chemo (every three weeks). She’s on the same combo as your dad will be. My Dad is home with my Mom, so I can’t speak fully to the him being alone preparedness, but I even want to get my mom a life alert thing or something to wear for if she’s down and no one notices quick enough. The biggest side effect for these combo of meds so far is sleepiness. The 24 hours post infusion your dad will have some energy because they infuse a steroid with the chemo, so there’s a little energy boost there. Then come Sunday/Monday he’ll be overwhelmingly sleepy. My mom is not a ~sleepy~ person and these meds have been knocking her out for days post chemo. My biggest help has been doing things around the house for her while she’s sleeping. Appetite is also suppressed, so try to find something that your dad will eat no matter what. You also have to give a pretty direct pep talk to your dad of “if you want a chance to fight this, you HAVE to eat. You can’t lose weight.” My mom needed this pep talk because as a woman she always celebrated losing weight. But now it’s an extremely bad thing. My last anecdote, is odds are you’re going to meet with the oncologist before the infusions just for discussions and updates. Idk if either of you guys are medical, but please look into as much as you can and make a list of any pertinent questions you want to ask the doctor. My mom leaves every single aspect of her care up to me, so if I don’t “know” whah the doctor is saying we’re all screwed, so I go into every appointment at the ready with every single bit of knowledge I can muster. It’s a depressing reality to face, but the US healthcare system isn’t set up so that most patients are ~cared~ about or ~advocated~ for. So you really have to fight for attention and answers. It’s rough. Good luck to you guys on the start of it all. there’s a lot of guilt that goes into being a not nearby child and I’m right there with you. My therapist helps me talk it out weekly lol. Keep the hope going for your dad because at the end that’s all we got.You’re so right. We’re “excited” to finally be doing something since the cancer was caught so tragically late. So doing something feels better than nothing. I will definitely be her eyes and years. And you’re right, figuring out who to call and when is half the battle. Learning that the healthcare system is beyond not a smooth oiled machine is, adding to the compounded stress.Thank you! Went as well as it could. We have the day one steroid energy right now, so hoping the crash isn’t too hard. She’s drinking plenty!Thank you for the insight.

424,MindlessParsley1446,"Thank you for sharing this. I'm so happy to hear the encouraging update on your mom ❤️❤️❤️May I ask why you don't have an oncologist? I'm really sorry to hear of your struggles. I've had many myself. I found that utilizing my anger energy towards doing some of the crappy stuff like dealing with thousands of dollars in insurance claims helped me through it - I felt like it was something within my control at least..I had no symptoms whatsoever. Stage IV lung cancer (ROS1+ Non-Small Cell)Hi, there and sorry to hear about your husband. I had an upper lobectomy last August. The recovery for me was definitely tolerable with pain medication. I was able to walk just fine, and did so as soon as the weather cooperated (midwesterner here, and weather can be all over the place!). I walked regularly to help improve lung capacity and strength. Sleeping was a challenge, though. I ended up purchasing a wedge pillow set (convertible for various angles and an under-the-knee pillow for support and comfort). I had to sleep sitting straight up for about a month (maybe more, can't remember now!). I also got a neck pillow to support my neck during sleep. I experienced what I call ""zingers"" where the incisions were, so was prescribed Gabapentin to help with that. I had the Robotic-assisted surgery, so about 5 small incisions. Since the opioids blocked me up, I made sure to take stool softener and also powdered Miralax to help keep things moving. Best of luck ❤️YES! 2nd leading cause is Radon!Fantastic news!! Congratulations 😊❤️When I went through chemo once/week via IV infusions of Carbo/Taxol, I made sure to drink plenty of water in order to help prep my veins for the IV as well as to help flush out my system. I brought and iPod with earbuds so I could listen to music. I went alone each time, and didn't want to hear any other noise from my surroundings there (peace of mind, I suppose). They did provide me blankets and snacks, which was so nice. I taped the ""instruction sheet"" to my fridge at home so my family would know what to watch for, as far as side effects/fever, etc, and the phone number to call if we needed help or had ANY questions. 😊 I'm praying for an uneventful experience for you and your mom.

441,NP_huh,"My fiancé and his mother sent stinker emails to all of them. The fact that his mother and one of the ENT docs were acquaintances was a coincidence. So no one we know will visit them ever again. They were just very apologetic and offering discounts. And were trying to get more involved post diagnosis. Which made me even angrier.I hope you’re doing better now. It’s frustrating but I’m glad you’re getting the treatment you deserve.What bugs me is that the doctors I visited could have atleast guided me to the correct department if they didn’t know how to help me. It’s sad but when I finally was taken seriously and was in the MRI machine, I was hoping they would find something off with me, just so I could prove the previous doctors wrong.Unfortunately, yes. I was dismissed even with the symptoms. I was prescribed basic painkillers and told to take it easy. Until one day when I couldn’t bear the pain anymore and had to rush to the ER.I’m so sorry you had to go through this. I hope you’re getting the correct course of treatment now. Sending good luck!Yes. My report states it as metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma. My oncologists have been referring to it as RCC.Very sorry to hear what you went through. Good luck to you too. Hope we come out stronger on the other side of this.Hello there fellow 31/F with brain mets. I’m on the same boat, RCC mets in many places, 2 in my brain. I underwent proton therapy for the same, and immunotherapy (keytruda) every 3 weeks with Cabo everyday. There has been significant reduction. I have to get MRIs every 3 months. And I’m very hopeful for the next one. I know overall it sucks. My lifestyle has changed a lot. I do not feel like the same person I used to be pre diagnosis. But hope keeps me going. Stay strong out there!!Stay strong! I know it’s easier said than done. I’m 31 with metastatic RCC (this pest is everywhere). Got diagnosed in April. Have gone through radiation and my immunotherapy cycles every 3 weeks. Lots of side effects but body is responding well (slowly but surely). And I totally understand what you feel. It’s very different when you’re the patient. Mainstream media portrays cancer like the endgame. But medicine has advanced so much. And if you have a good support system and people rooting for you, you are so so lucky. It sucks, no doubt. I’m not the same person anymore. I had a very active lifestyle, I used to power lift, I still have my job but I’m on a sabbatical. I loved going for dinners. But the disease has changed me. It’s the energy levels and side effects from the treatments. Was on corticosteroids that made me gain a lot of weight. But I dunno, maybe I’m delusional sometimes, but I see myself getting back to my old life slowly. Really slowly, but surely. I’d like to wish you luck on your journey!!",323,0,0,"['start', 'my', 'fiancé', 'mother', 'sent', 'stinker', 'emails', 'the', 'fact', 'mother', 'one', 'ent', 'docs', 'acquaintances', 'coincidence', 'so', 'one', 'know', 'visit', 'ever', 'they', 'apologetic', 'offering', 'discounts', 'and', 'trying', 'get', 'involved', 'post', 'diagnosis', 'which', 'made', 'even', 'angrieri', 'hope', '’', 'better', 'it', '’', 'frustrating', 'i', '’', 'glad', '’', 'getting', 'treatment', 'deservewhat', 'bugs', 'doctors', 'i', 'visited', 'could', 'atleast', 'guided', 'correct', 'department', '’', 'know', 'help', 'it', '’', 'sad', 'i', 'finally', 'taken', 'seriously', 'mri', 'machine', 'i', 'hoping', 'would', 'find', 'something', 'i', 'could', 'prove', 'previous', 'doctors', 'wrongunfortunately', 'yes', 'i', 'dismissed', 'even', 'symptoms', 'i', 'prescribed', 'basic', 'painkillers', 'told', 'take', 'easy', 'until', 'one', 'day', 'i', '’', 'bear', 'pain', 'anymore', 'rush', 'eri', '’', 'sorry', 'go', 'i', 'hope', '’', 'getting', 'correct', 'course', 'treatment', 'sending', 'good', 'luckyes', 'my', 'report', 'states', 'metastatic', 'renal', 'clear', 'cell', 'carcinoma', 'my', 'oncologists', 'referring', 'rccvery', 'sorry', 'hear', 'went', 'good', 'luck', 'hope', 'come', 'stronger', 'side', 'thishello', 'fellow', '31f', 'brain', 'mets', 'i', '’', 'boat', 'rcc', 'mets', 'many', 'places', '2', 'brain', 'i', 'underwent', 'proton', 'therapy', 'immunotherapy', 'keytruda', 'every', '3', 'weeks', 'cabo', 'everyday', 'there', 'significant', 'reduction', 'i', 'get', 'mris', 'every', '3', 'months', 'and', 'i', '’', 'hopeful', 'next', 'one', 'i', 'know', 'overall', 'sucks', 'my', 'lifestyle', 'changed', 'lot', 'i', 'feel', 'like', 'person', 'i', 'used', 'pre', 'diagnosis', 'but', 'hope', 'keeps', 'going', 'stay', 'strong', 'therestay', 'strong', 'i', 'know', '’', 'easier', 'said', 'done', 'i', '’', '31', 'metastatic', 'rcc', 'pest', 'everywhere', 'got', 'diagnosed', 'april', 'have', 'gone', 'radiation', 'immunotherapy', 'cycles', 'every', '3', 'weeks', 'lots', 'side', 'effects', 'body', 'responding', 'well', 'slowly', 'surely', 'and', 'i', 'totally', 'understand', 'feel', 'it', '’', 'different', '’', 'patient', 'mainstream', 'media', 'portrays', 'cancer', 'like', 'endgame', 'but', 'medicine', 'advanced', 'much', 'and', 'good', 'support', 'system', 'people', 'rooting', 'lucky', 'it', 'sucks', 'doubt', 'i', '’', 'person', 'anymore', 'i', 'active', 'lifestyle', 'i', 'used', 'power', 'lift', 'i', 'still', 'job', 'i', '’', 'sabbatical', 'i', 'loved', 'going', 'dinners', 'but', 'disease', 'changed', 'it', '’', 'energy', 'levels', 'side', 'effects', 'treatments', 'was', 'corticosteroids', 'made', 'gain', 'lot', 'weight', 'but', 'i', 'dunno', 'maybe', 'i', '’', 'delusional', 'sometimes', 'i', 'see', 'getting', 'back', 'old', 'life', 'slowly', 'really', 'slowly', 'surely', 'i', '’', 'like', 'wish', 'luck', 'journey', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,['Radiation Therapy'],Unable to specify

It wasn’t looking good but I went forward with aggressive chemo and 6 months, 5 rounds and 1 total hysterectomy/bilateral oopherectomy and tumor debulking I am cancer-free. Last two rounds are for good measure and I’ll do immunotherapy every six weeks probably forever due to a gene defect but I am hopeful. I’ve come a long way since my diagnosis.

473,OffMyRocker2016,"I'm so sorry to hear of your diagnosis. You should also post this into r/breastcancer too for even more direct support. . Take care in the meantime, OP. 🌻Not for me. I've tried it when I was initially at stage IIIB (with 100% PDL expression) and I failed on it right away, after the first 3 month cycle, unfortunately. Then I tried Keytruda next and I failed miserably on that immunotherapy, too, sadly. It was devastating for me because I was so hopeful with having such a high PDL expression, but it just didn't work out for me. People with 50% or higher PDL expression typically can do very well with immunotherapy treatment. Now, I'm very happy to report that, although I'm stage IV, for 2.5 years now (cross myself lol), I'm back on chemo that was one of my first line treatments 3.7 years ago, Taxol (paclitaxel), and so far I'm doing pretty well on it. Just had my first 3 month scans after starting back on it and I'm currently stable/shrinking my liver mets, thankfully. I'm hoping to stay on this for at least another 3-9 months or more if im super lucky.. fingers crossed. Everyone is different though and many factors are involved in treatment success or failure along the process. Late stage cancer is a bitch. Constantly switching treatments is just part of the Whack-a-Mole game we have to play in these later stages of our cancer life, unfortunately. It's kind of like chasing your tail in a way. Lol But you just do your best to get through it, one scan at a time, with lots of hope for good results in each one. 🌻Oh..I forgot to mention that I had the similar treatment plan and know his throat pain well. Had 30 sessions of radiation to my primary in the right lower lobe and my medistinal lymph nodes (center of chest) and it was beyond awful. At the same time, I was on Carbo/Taxol for 6 weeks at that time. It's going to take some time, like a couple of months after completion, for his soreness to improve, imo. That burn is something else and I'll never forget it. Ugh. I had hydrocodone oral syrup to use/take 30 minutes before eating and that was a lifesaver on top of the extended release morphine tablets and lidocaine oral solution as well to drink. Great 3-med combo that really helped me eat pretty successfully every day. My Rad Onc is the best!

508,Party_Author_9337,"So most young non smoker with lung cancer have a targetable dna mutation. I did not. But most do. And if they do, there is a good chance that they can be treated with specific medications. I think it took about a month for my bio markers to come back. It was a long wait.I am sorry about your teenage lung cancer. That should never happen. It’s just not fair. I was 38 when I was diagnosed, which is still young for lung cancer but not pediatric. Ask your oncologist to talk to a social worker. They can get you in touch with support groups. I found a lot of comfort in this group. There are a few other women I have met via TikTok who are also in their 30s with lung cancerI ate pretzels and watermelon the week after chemo. It causes a really bad taste in my mouth. So I didn’t have much of an appetiteI was 39 when I did my chemo for lung cancer. It wiped me out days 3-6 I would take multiple naps a day. I would purchase a urinal from Amazon incase the fatigue from chemo makes it hard for your dad to get to the bathroom. Also, have his doctors prescribed a Walker? Or maybe useful if you have to take him back to the office the first week post chemo. Has he tried sleeping with a wedge pillow? Google pills for acid reflex. That might help keep him upright but let him stretch out in bed. I am glad he is drinking water now. Chemo can change your taste buds for a week or two. So water may taste bad. Buy some flavored water packets. Don’t stock up on anything pre chemo. I also lived alone and I bought what I thought I would want to eat if I had the stomach but. But my taste was so off, I didn’t want any of it. Made me hate the taste of the yellow gatoraid. Which was my favorite. I was able to drink the blue flavor, which I normally don’t like. If he is already really bad at eating, you might want to look into continuous glucose monitor. See if he would wear it. That way you can see if his sugar is going too low from not eatingAsk about pain medication for home use after the surgery. My surgeon refused to treat pain with opioids. After two to three weeks of unbearable pain, my friend suggested I reach out to my oncologist. She had no issue treating my pain. Use the incentive spirometer. And walk. Sleeping can be uncomfortable. Make sure you have a few comfy pillows in different sizes to help find a position of comfortI was 38 when I was diagnosed, non smoker. I wish I could blame it on stress. But we don’t know why it’s more commonI had a lobectomy for my lung cancer. I was never offered radiation. I am glad the tumor was removed. I also had like 20 lymph nodes removed and biopsied.The chemo days will have you at the infusion center almost all day. Be prepared to hurry up and wait. Usually the access the port and draw labs. Wait for the lab results. Then wait for in the drugs to be prepared. My oncologist would hydrate me with a bag of IV fluids and nausea medication before the chemo started.

Just for people reading this .. most mutations in lung cancer are not inherited but are somatic mutations (meaning damage that occurs throughout one’s life time).. not passed on. They are trying to figure out if there are any other genetics that predispose people without risk factors to lung cancer but mutations such as EGFR ALK RET aren’t typically inherited .. genomic mutations vs geneticLung cancer in never smokers is on the rise they don’t really know whyThis recent webinar does a nice job explaining it:https://gkc.go2.org/pages/inherit-studyIf she has a targetable mutation like EGFR .. and gets on right treatment she could start to feel so much better within days 🤍Wow amazing !

512,PetalumaDr,"Not sure if discussing what your fears are with those who love you and know you best would help or not. I doubt it would hurt. I'm not sure if the fear is surgical complication, death, losing a part of who you are with a gender specific body part, loss of control when out,... All are valid fears and some can be addressed by your care team and some by friends and family. It often turns out that cognitive work around say a risk of dying from surgery being 1/10,000 can help with that specific fear (that is less than the risk of dying by driving to the hospital). Good luck.Beautiful thoughts. Thanks for sharing. I might counter with the fact that most battles are not ones of our choosing, Ukraine, Gaza, Bhagavad Gita,... There are no winners in war, just relative degrees of loss. Cancer is but one manifestation of our simple mortal reality- we are born, we suffer, we die. Nothing particularly special about cancer in that regard other than it often puts us in the 80% of people who know their time on this plane is limited (as opposed to the 20% who just don't wake up some morning). I completely agree that it isn't about winning or losing ""the battle"" but whether one feels gratitude for the life they have had. The quality of a life is not measured in years but in connections. Sitting here with my terminal cancer that I will never ""beat"" I am amazed at the life I have had and can feel nothing but gratitude. I hope the same is true for you my friend.Clearly not a rash decision, and clearly your call. The only thought I have (which may already have occurred) is whether you have spoken to a Palliative Care doctor about your goals of care and making sure you have a smooth transition from chemo to just managing your symptoms for the best quality of life you can have in your remaining time. I seriously doubt any sane physician or informed loving parent would try to stop you after 7 years of chemo.I don' know the rules in England but you should have the right to speak with your Radiation Oncologist and get their expert opinion on whether you are done with radiation or not. Agree with pain specialist if Oncologist not adequately addressing the pain. Good luck.I'm sorry this is happening to you. I have no wisdom or pithy comments for you, just compassion for your circumstances. Good luck.I am a retired physician with cancer but not a psychiatrist so take everything I say with a large grain of salt. Roughly 13% of our population has a personality disorder and it is not uncommon that they partner with someone who also has a personality disorder. Their children often have difficult lives because of that. You mentioned narcissistic and it is possible that they have a narcissistic personality disorder. We now know from the work of Simon Baron Cohen and others that they have broken brains with failed neuro circuits as demonstrated on fMRI, which preclude them from feeling empathy- he calls it the ""empathy circuit"" (and yes he is Sasha Baron Cohen's or Borat's cousin). Perhaps neither of your parents would really be diagnosed with a personality disorder if evaluated but it isn't totally important to the point because the concept can help you with your pain and suffering and may free you a bit from this suffering. The most prevailing theory now is that people who have personality disorders have them because of childhood trauma, which causes them to create a dysfunctional way of walking through the world, in order to get by. So they are in a sense broken before they are old enough to have their own children or get a fMRI to confirm that they lack the empathy circuit the rest of us have. So you get to decide whether to sit in the sadness and hurt of what sounds like a very abnormal parental response to your cancer, or you can choose to see it through a lens of empathy and gratitude. To see the abused 5 year olds who didn't do anything to deserve having their brains remolded by childhood trauma, to be glad that you can feel empathy, and to be grateful that they were somehow able to raise you in an environment that allowed you to feel empathy despite not growing up in one themselves. Imagine how barren your life would be if you could not feel empathy. I could be way off base but this allows you a framework to see their actions as the best they could do given what they have been given to work with in their lives. I sincerely hope this helps provide some perspective.Excellent point. I was fortunate enough to be given an early appointment with a Palliative Care/Symptom Management doctor when I received my initial terminal diagnosis. It has allowed me a forum to discuss not only symptom management but goals of care. My understanding is that some areas of the country are understaffed with Palliative Care doctors, which may or may not be the case in your situation.I'm not sure that there is a way as a human being to be hit with this info and not feel overwhelmed. There will no doubt be many ups and downs. Few of us ""thought this would happen to us"". Your doctors, nurses, therapists, ... deal with overwhelmed people all day and the good ones will be life rafts for you as you feel yourself drowning in the uncertainty, mortality worries,... I would strongly suggest getting an Oncology Psychologist ASAP if one is available locally and you can fit it into your insurance/finances. They see overwhelmed people all day, every day and can help you navigate all of the uncertainty and worries that are both universal and unique to your situation. Good luck.Yes- very normal and you have already chosen the most functional response to this very common but overwhelming situation- to seek the counsel and wisdom of experts that comes from experience, which makes this situation ""normal"" in their work world. I was given a grim prognosis and rushed to get my affairs in order and to get a good second opinion. What you need is shepherding to help you come to the realization that most of us die and leave our families sooner than we want to, or have partners die and leave us sooner than we wanted them to (whether it is in your 20s or 80s). It almost seems like a shock to me in retrospect that most of us go through life without understanding that basic fact. The Stoics and many others tried to convey this to us through their teachings. I hope for you that it ends up being many many decades in the future. Good luck.Dunning Krueger textbook case. He is lucky you didn’t laugh at him. That would have really made him cry.

534,Previous_Basis8862,"My mum died 4 weeks after diagnosis of state 4 lung cancer. The rapid deterioration happened about a week after diagnosis when she contracted pneumonia. It was a massive shock to all of us but in many ways probably better for her than suffering through months of treatment that might only have prolonged her suffering. She had been very fit and healthy right up until 3 months before diagnosis and she kept getting the brush off from her doctors - they told her it was a chest infection, sinus infection, arthritis potentially. Eventually a rheumatologist sent her for scans and that’s when it was caught. I’m so sorry you are all going through this. I wish your mum a peaceful passing.I’m so sorry to hear this. My mum had what she and her doctors seemed to think were recurrent sinus and chest infections. She was on antibiotics on and off for 4 months. She started getting joint pain so was finally referred to a rheumatologist who thought she might have an autoimmune disorder and sent her for scans - lung cancer that had already spread to her bones. She was sent for a brain scan too as she was having excruciating headaches but we never got the results of that because unfortunately she passed away from (mainly) pneumonia just 4 weeks after that original scan. Immunotherapy was what the oncologists were talking about as her best chance though and it gave one of my friends and extra 15 months after she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer with brain and bone mets.

I got my diagnosis over a month ago for a rare subtype of lymphoma and have been hit with a visceral sense of our privilege, our ability to afford this second chance at life. So many people in our country cannot afford it, it is surreal. I worry sometimes that if my cancer comes back, I may not have access to the new immunotherapy drugs and trials that people discuss here as further lines of treatment. But we are catching up in the bigger cities with the treatments. I am grateful that I have access to a relatively new chemo protocol.

How do you think I'm feeling, I have cancer. But I like it when they send me a meme or something, I don't feel like reporting on my illness always and I really hate the ""oh no what happened"" if I do tell them I'm hanging in there.

573,SDamon83,"I just read this article about a man with lung cancer who they gave him months to live. It was metastatic lung cancer. he chose to get off treatment and he moved out of the US to Greece and drank red wine, ate healthy Greek food and worked in the vineyards. Since that diagnosis he is still alive 40+ years later. Miracles do happen. Follow your heart. Your higher self knows best. Everybody‘s cancer is unique and different. They’re alternative remedies, that you can take that that destroys cancer. As I said miracles do happen and I think a power greater than ourselves is in control. Spirituality is very important to me. I hate the Targeted therapy pills that I’m taking that have left me pretty much a homebody. I don’t work out anymore and I’m gaining so much weight. Currently, I’m suffering from acute inflammation where I have so much pain all over my body. Also these pharmaceuticals mess with brain chemistry so we have brain fog and we don’t think as sharply as we used to. I’ve had a little bit of chemotherapy and I hated the effect two days after when I felt like just killing myself. What chemotherapy does to the body is horrible. I think Western medicine sucks. And the science community as well. This day and age they should have something much better that can eradicate cancer. But chemotherapy and the targeted therapies are BIG money makers for big Pharma. My Oncologist stated that I have up to seven years to live. I laugh at that. How do they know?? They are not God. If they found a cure for cancer or offered cure for cancer they would go out business. I swear that Pharma is like a mafia. May God bless you and guide you in your decisions .

I took her to the ER on 1/26/24 for hip pain and swelling on her side that she thought was a hernia, they did a CT scan and found masses all throughout her abdomen. It was so shocking to hear after sitting in the ER for 6 hours awaiting the likely news that she would need hernia surgery. Turns out there was no hernia, it was a giant mass. She was admitted and after MRIs and tests, stage IV lung cancer with 30+ tiny brain metastases. The outlook was optimistic from the oncology team, considering how advanced her disease was. They gave her a year and a half. She did targeted radiation for the brain tumors and got through 2 chemo treatments (w/ immunotherapy). She did have the biomarker testing and qualified for a trial, which she didn't live long enough to participate in. She passed on 4/16, on my birthday. It only took 12 weeks. She started to decline from day 1 of diagnosis, losing the ability to walk, use the bathroom, see, think/talk clearly, etc. The chemo/immuno was working on the disease in her body, but the damage to her brain was too great. Turns out she was having mini strokes, despite being on Eliquis, which really baffled the Doctors. Just before we got that last piece of news, she had decided she was done with treatment. She was only on hospice for 6 days. I share my story to show that you are not alone. This monster of a disease is wreaking havoc on many of us. I am haunted by my thoughts of what I could've done differently if I had known she would be gone so quickly. It helps for me to share these thoughts with people I trust or in a forum like this. If I don't, I feel consumed by it. I've also learned that setting aside some time where you plan to just feel the pain helps my ability to focus on tasks (like work or kid stuff) during other times. If my grief is triggered by a thought or memory, I remind myself that I can explore that more during my planned time. Sometimes I include my 11 y/o daughter in these planned times (they were super close).

660,Terrible-Big-Baby888,"Sounds ideal but.. when you’re sick and exhausted and defeated and angry (but heavy on the sick part)… all of this is MORE energy being dispersed.. when you already have so little. I do wish that these acts would change things, but they hardly do. A lot of people recommended I go back and tell these doctors/APRNs off but I’m tired—I didn’t want to feel more exhausted after poppin off.. so idk, just wanted to share my two cents.Yep—always push and demand what you know you need. I had a similar experience being dismissed that everything I was experiencing was only side effects of medications I was on… again, until I couldn’t walk and was in so much pain I ended up at the ER too.. (I’m also in my early 30s). It makes me angry to think of how many times I was expressing symptoms of something going wrong and they dismissed it. I can 100% sympathize with you. I hope that the medicine continues to do what it needs to do to get everything under control. Moral of the story: only YOU know your body best so KEEP FIGHTING FOR YOU! Nobody else will!!!It sure is a fucked up system that has killed a lot of people. I’m not surprised it was a female doctor that finally listened (don’t care if I sound sexist..). And I’m also not surprised that you still talk with her. My breast surgeon saved my life and I tell her that alllllll the time. I would say she still saves my life because she advocates for me often. I’m happy to hear that you are alive today. And that someone did finally listen to you. It is scary when you hear how little time you could’ve had if you hadn’t been so persistent. I wish you the absolute best.Hey—I can relate to a lot of what you’re saying regarding feeling like you’ll be yourself again OR even the having to begin the “journey” over. We’re tired. We’re defeated. We’re isolated and alone. We’re beat up but most of all.. we’re scared. I learned the hard way that if you are able to.. and up to it.. and not too sick.. you HAVE to be your own advocate.. fight for what you know you need. Demand it. Also.. fuck the medical bills (but I understand that feeling of rage/anger/underlying stress of being unable to pay/refusing to pay).. but.. shred them. Trash them. Remember the quality of your life has no price tag on it. And those bills will NOT matter when we’re at the final stages of this “journey.” I too kicked ASS at treatment last year to only end up sicker and in a way more severe state this year. It’s not fair at all & we have no choice if we want to live a bit longer. Anyways, I don’t think we will ever feel like ourselves again. So much of our “selves” has been taken from us without any of our say… so I am trying to work hard at grieving my previous self and I recommend you trying to do the same. And in my grieving (which we’re grieving so much more than that)… I’m gaining acceptance of my situation (as best I can). It’s heartbreaking and only YOU understand the devastation. Despite your situation resonating with me—still, only YOU understand YOUR devastation. But we can never go back to before our diagnosis or our battle to beat cancer. We can only keep moving forward. I don’t mean to use toxic positivity because fuck that, I’m bout to spazz on the next person that uses that on me.. but if we can have moments of hope, and moments of acceptance and moments of still loving ourselves.. then we will take it. Because yes, we are tired. We are beat up. We’re scared. We lack trust in the medical field. And we feel alone.. I’m here. New to Reddit but figuring it out & seeing there are communities here that truly support (and real dumbasses that are entertainingly stupid). You may message me anytime. We can chat isolation and devastation. You’re not alone, just like I’m not alone.You want to feel “boring” in this community.. could be perceived as insensitive to those that have situations that are certainly anything but “boring.” I just hope you are doing better and that your breast cancer does not return. Cancer in any-way-shape-or-form is not “boring.”I was re-diagnosed in June. June 18th to be exact. Stage 4, working on maintenance chemo/hormone therapies to extend my life/quality of life.. I’m sure how we are feeling at this current time is quite similar. I’m struggling to be positive and hopeful but there are good days/bad days, I am sending you love & and big hug. Cancer survivors are some of the baddest, strongest, most resilient people I know. Thank you for sharing & giving me an opportunity to relate to someone,I take CBD/THC infused gummies before bed to help with nausea/sleep/appetite. I do also smoke but I’d stick with the gummies for mom. Remind her.. none of this is ideal but we want her better and part of that is getting through chemo & being able to eat. I will be hoping for the best for her 💗Will be thinking of you. Close in age to when I was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer. All I can say is—we are so so so much stronger than we know. And lean on your loved ones. Let people help you & your wife & daughter.

671,This-Army6223,"Yes I did it. Dealing with stage 4 Endometrial cancer , a rare aggressive kind. I did many lines of treatment since May of 2023 and none of them got rid of it. It started spreading again despite other medications etc. In June , the oncologist told me that he wanted to start taxol again . That was my option. I told him nope. It was horrendous before and I was not doing it again if it wasn't even going to cure it. Once you quit treatment , your doctor recommends you for hospice. I believe you need a prognosis of six months or less for hospice. I love my hospice nurse. She comes once a week right now , unless I can convince her to do a telehealth visit. She makes medication suggestions and everything is at the doorstep next day.Right now I'm still active and busy. I'm dealing with overall body aches and pains like when you have the flu, and liver pain. But I take pain meds that are available to me and I do normal as much as possible. I go out often, drive places , cook, etc. Once you are on hospice, they will stop treatment for everything. So just be aware of that. For instance, they suspected that I had a blood clot in my leg. I was told since I'm in hospice it was not going to be treated, however if I wanted it to be treated I could take myself off of hospice, have whatever procedure done, and then sign myself right on again the next day. So it's not like once you're on hospice you're stuck there. You can take yourself off if you decide to have a treatment etc. I hope this helps. For me, it was an easy choice because chemo was such hell, and I wasn't about to do that again if it wasn't going to result in at least a remission etc.Also , I would strongly suggest an antidepressant. The kind of crap we've dealt with would leave anyone with a scrambled brain. I was crying constantly. I told my oncologist flat out I was not okay. She recommended me to the hospital's cancer psychiatrist who put me on a low dose of antidepressant. It's honestly been extremely game changing for me. The hospice nurse can also can give medications for anxiety etc. I'm so sorry you're dealing with all this crap.Wow, you are a rock star! That's amazing!Also understand that you can pick and choose what to do with hospice. I find my hospice nurse to be amazingly chill and flexible. I decided to stop the social worker services. I wasn't crazy about her constant talk about needing to know all my funeral arrangements etc. and how do I feel about becoming incapacitated etc ( I think it's great, how would you feel??) I am still living here and now and very active and want to focus on that for now. So no more social worker. No chaplain because I have a wonderful pastor and his wife who look after me by calling every couple of days to pray with me and talk etc. My adult kids who live at home are in counseling and my husband starts counseling this week. So adding a social worker to the mix is just more time away from doing all i want to do and they are a-okay with all that.I find hospice to be very flexible and reassuring. I sought their help long before I really needed it and it absolutely put my mind at ease. It took me a week to build up the courage to call once the doctor put in the recommendation, but im glad I did.No it's normal. I am battling endometrial cancer at 55. I have permanent sags under my eyes from crying this past year. Let me tell you, you need to get help. I finally bottomed out and said I need help. They set me up at the hospital psychiatrist who put me on an antidepressant. It helped immediately. I'm also on Ativan as needed. They honestly do not understand the psychological and emotional impact of cancer. I'm hoping that once you get the surgery you start to feel better. A lot of this is dread and fear. All of your emotions are normal and you're not going crazy. Cancer is a rape and a thief ; it steals from you, it violates your body it invades your life and your plans. Everything that you're going through is normal however that doesn't mean that you have to endure it. There are medications that can help you. I've never been on an antidepressant in my life and never thought I needed it. However within a week of starting to take the anti depressant I began to be able to think clearer. Horrible anxiety went away. Hang in there and check back in because there were many people here who know exactly how you feel.Totally get it , I have a very rare and aggressive endometrial and yet another friend today is trying to send me another alternative remedy. I told her please don't. I've tried them ALL and nothing worked and all the regular medical stuff didn't either. People think cancer is cancer. Chris beat cancer so that means you can too. Never mind that every cancer and every body is different! Ugh it's frustrating. I finally just said ""look, it's me and God now and I'm at peace with whatever happens. If I get an unexplained miracle, I'm at peace. If I go home, I'm at peace. But I'm not chasing down the next snake oil or rabbit hole"". People don't understand that not all cancer is the same. Treatment for endometrial is vastly underfunded because it's so rare. Treatment for metastatic breast cancer HAS come a long way because it's so common and so well funded. People don't get it. They aren't all the sameI had a friend on another group in 2010 who was given 36 months with metastatic breast cancer in several places. She had two babies. She ended up living about ten more years. Hand in there mama, a moms desire to live is the greatest of all because of her children. Praying a great treatment for you to knock this down and out for many good years with your family!I stopped chemo. It wasn't working and the option I had to knock it back was hard chemo again. I said no way. If it was just gonna give me extra months forget that crap. I thought I'd die on taxol the first time around. No way. Now I'm active and living well but on hospice. The tumors hurt and have grown a lot. But I'm still here. This is a decision that you have to make, nobody else. Just like mine was. I remember talking to my mom about it, and she said nobody can make that decision except you. I was honestly sick and tired of being a patient, sick and tired of being with the cancer center constantly, sick and tired of low blood counts pain and all the other things that come along with cancer treatment. I did it for a year and a half and basically had nothing to show for it at the end of that. So my situation is a little different than yours. It sounds like your chemo has somewhat kept it at bay so you have to make the choice to keep going with it and can you live with the side effects, or to just say no more. There's no one that can tell you what is right or wrong except for you. Nobody who hasn't gone through this can possibly understand what it's like. I'm really tough and I can power through a lot if it's got a good end result, but for me it was just going to prolong things. I think if I was given the option of a treatment that would possibly eradicate it and put me into remission , I would do that. This is a discussion you need to have with your oncologist as well. My oncologist was really great. He told me he wanted to put me back on taxol since then the other chemos were working, and I told him no. He said,""talk to me"". I appreciate it that he was so open to listening. I told him that there was no way I was doing taxol again. It was crappy in 2010 when I did it for breast cancer but it was far more crappy and I thought I would die when I did it last year for endometrial cancer and I'm not doing it again. He listened to me and didn't try to change my decision and was completely respectful of that. He did make sure that I knew that no treatment meant that the disease would progress. I told him I wasn't afraid.Pathology shouldn't show the stage, stage is determined by the location of the tumor(s) and size. If cancer spreads from its original place to an organ or bones that is called stage 4. That being said people can live with stage 4 cancer for many years depending on treatment , etc. I'm sorry , nothing sucks more than bad cancer news. Push your doctor for next steps! If it's just in one location often they can surgically remove it or radiate it.I'm surprised with stage 2 that you didn't need chemo. I had chemo at stage 2a. I guess it depends on the grade. Anyway chemo for breast cancer is def doable. Keep on your anti nausea meds. Do you know who Lorna Luft is? Judy Garlands daughter. She's a singer in her 70s now. Well she had breast cancer and it came back in her ribs and a spot on her brain. She had surgery for both and treatment and they removed some of her ribs etc. My point is that she's back to doing concerts the past few years since that happened! And living a very full life. Often breast cancer can be lived with for a long long time. Take one day at a time. Don't fear chemo. Take one chemo at a time. Just keep focused on the day in front of you.I had palliative radiation to my hip even though I already had pelvic radiation. A good radiation oncologist will assess how much radiation you've had to an area and see if they can give you a couple doses more. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Bone mets suck. Mine absolutely throbbed. The radiation did help.Honestly you can't. You just need to keep telling them every cancer is different and your care team knows what kind yours is, etc. It is maddening I know. I recently stopped treatment because nothing is working and I have a friend who insisted that there was a kind of chemo that has zero side effects and it kills everything cancer. It's like yeah I think that if that was available to me it would be available to me. Kept insisting that I asked my doctor so I finally did just to shut her up and no it's not an option and yes it has a ton of side effects. People see or hear one thing online or they see some kind of TV commercial or something and they think they have the answer. It really makes everything about cancer even harder when you have people coming at you from all sides with all sorts of "" cures"" some of the medical and some of them are not. There was a woman at church who constantly approaches me and I finally just keep telling her no. No, no more. I think she finally got the clue this last time. The hard thing is that these people mean well and they want to see you well. But they have no idea that it's very taxing to hear this kind of thing coming at you from all directions.Delta 8 gummies helped me with nausea and allergies but I'm ultra sensitive and I didn't like how they made me feel. I couldn't even tolerate a half in without being buzzy. Can she layer compazine and zofran together?I wouldn't have read the results. I never looked at my reports until I was sitting with the doctor. But since you already did, just know that I had a solid lymph node at my collar bone after having a mastectomy. I totally lost my mind. They scanned it and it was a solid mass. They surgically removed it and biopsied it and it was nothing, just what they called a benign ""reactive node"". Idk why it was solid but it was nothing at all. That was in 2011. Also immunotherapy can cause massive lung nodules. I imagine other drugs can too. I know someone whose lungs were full of them after keytruda and now they are all gone. So don't panic now. Do you have Xanax or Ativan you can take for this weekend?",1187,0,0,"['start', 'yes', 'i', 'dealing', 'stage', '4', 'endometrial', 'cancer', 'rare', 'aggressive', 'kind', 'i', 'many', 'lines',

686,TrashPandaNotACat,"I'm sorry you and your mom are dealing with this. You're right to be concerned about the back pain. My father's lung cancer spread to his spine. Regular CT and PET scans are very important during treatment and after.I was in a similar position - stage 1a3 tumor in left upper lobe, deemed nonoperable due to diminished lung capacity in right lung from emphysema. Treated with radiation, all signs point to tumor killed, and offered spot in immunotherapy clinical trial to see about using durvalumab to prevent reoccurance. Mine is a double blind study, where I dont know if I'm getting the placebo or the real drug. I opted to do it, despite the possible side effects, because it can come back and because it means they'll be keeping a much closer eye on me than if I wasnt in trial. I get a CT more frequently, PET scans more frequently, and meet with oncologist more frequently. Because of this more frequent testing, we caught 2 large colon polyps right before they became cancerous (they lit up on PET scan, but were declared precancerous when removed and tested). So, that keeping a closer eye on things has already paid off (I'm a little over a year into the trial). Is the flying to Houston every 4 weeks for my clinical trial a bit of a pain? Yes. Is it worth it? For me, yes.Another thing to keep in mind - you can drop out of the trial at any time.",146,0,0,"['start', 'im', 'sorry', 'mom', 'dealing', 'youre', 'right', 'concerned', 'back', 'pain', 'my', 'fathers', 'lung', 'cancer', 'spread', 'spine', 'regular', 'ct', 'pet', 'scans', 'important', 'treatment', 'afteri', 'similar', 'position', 'stage', '1a3', 'tumor', 'left', 'upper', 'lobe', 'deemed', 'nonoperable', 'due', 'diminished', 'lung', 'capacity', 'right', 'lung', 'emphysema', 'treated', 'radiation', 'signs', 'point', 'tumor', 'killed', 'offered', 'spot', 'immunotherapy', 'clinical', 'trial', 'see', 'using', 'durvalumab', 'prevent', 'reoccurance', 'mine', 'double', 'blind', 'study', 'i', 'dont', 'know', 'im', 'getting', 'placebo', 'real', 'drug', 'i', 'opted', 'despite', 'possible', 'side', 'effects', 'come', 'back', 'means', 'theyll', 'keeping', 'much', 'closer', 'eye', 'i', 'wasnt', 'trial', 'i', 'get', 'ct', 'frequently', 'pet', 'scans', 'frequently', 'meet', 'oncologist', 'frequently', 'because', 'frequent', 'testing', 'caught', '2', 'large', 'colon', 'polyps', 'right', 'became', 'cancerous', 'lit', 'pet', 'scan', 'declared', 'precancerous', 'removed', 'tested', 'so', 'keeping', 'closer', 'eye', 'things', 'already', 'paid', 'im', 'little', 'year', 'trial', 'is', 'flying', 'houston', 'every', '4', 'weeks', 'clinical', 'trial', 'bit', 'pain', 'yes', 'is', 'worth', 'for', 'yesanother', 'thing', 'keep', 'mind', 'drop', 'trial', 'time', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,['Radiation Therapy'],carcinoma

718,WhodatSooner,"👏👏👏I don’t know the lingo exactly but I have clear cell renal carcinoma. Is that RCC?Hahaha 😂. It’s like you are a different person. I’m a Cajun / Creole guy who loved Hatch Chile season and cooking paella with fresh rosemary and high quality saffron. My wife is a Laos chef so she makes a papaya salad that would buckle your knees and a Larp that would throw so many flavors and textures that you could eat it for days in a row and never get bored. And all of that is long gone. All of those subtle flavors and balanced ingredients- the freshness of good shrimp, the pop of cilantro in a ceviche? Bye bye.😂✌️❤️🫵Yeah. You got it. Even if / when they stop treating you for whatever reason, it’s the fight to keep trying to live and love as much as you possibly can - no matter what it takes- for one day. And if you wake up, try to do it again but be ok with yourself if you can’t.I never got back to anything resembling good. I’m terminal, so surgery, radiation and chemo were all just attempts to relieve pain and maybe prolong life. They did both to a degree, but yeah, all of the things you mentioned are just the new normal. Some days better than others but we try our hardest to just keep living until I don’t. We’ve made some pretty good memories that we weren’t supposed to have a chance at. Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but if / when I think about what I was “before” it crushes my spirit. When I decide to just fight through the misery and the pain, we usually manage to enjoy life. We can’t do it every day, or even every month, but sometimes we can and it’s worth it. I’m blessed with a very special woman who plays by the official “through sickness and in health” rule, and she never overreacts in either direction. I think that helps. Just try to keep trying when you can and forgive yourself when you can’t. ✊✌️❤️🫵I am so sorry. Yes, it’s very scary when you learn that there is no cure for your particular brand of cancer and even the oncologists can only say something like “maybe 2 years but prepare for 3 months”. I made my 2 years and there have been many of those days I would like to give back. I would have preferred 3 months without pain to 2 years of this but then every once in awhile I manage to string together maybe 5 good days in a row. So I have no wisdom to share other than to try to recognize that it’s ok to feel like shit. Don’t feel bad about feeling bad. Try to allow yourself to take advantage of the better days somehow. Anything to make that day different will do. Sometimes that means I have enough energy to cook and feel good enough to actually eat some of it. And don’t take any shit from anyone ever again. I was a smoker and like you, what I have is entirely unrelated to that according to every oncologist I’ve talked to and all of the research I’ve done on my own. But at the beginning I had to hear that shit from some people and then there were other people who I knew were saying that about me because I knew what catty gossips they were. I cut them all out of my life completely. In fact, I cut everyone out of my life other than my family and my two closest friends. I actually put together a message I sent out to well meaning people who with good intentions would call or text me to “check in.” I couldn’t fucking take it so I told them all that I was cutting them out and my reason for doing so. I didn’t apologize. That was something I needed to do to get by so I did it. Maybe you prefer more attention and if so then by all means cultivate those relationships. The point is it’s ok to be selfish in this regard one way or another. I have six children (ages 32-16) two grandchildren and a wife I absolutely adore so those are plenty o feelings for me to be concerned with now. Not my old law partners or old teammates or anyone else. Also, for me, marijuana is very helpful and it’s a little known secret that anyone can get it mailed to you legally unless you live in Idaho. I get mine from Mood or Cheech & Chong. For me, I had awfully bad experiences with all of the opioids and narcotics. They even tried some sort of steroid on me and I literally went into a full blown roid rage. Scared the living shit out of everyone including me. I do take the slow release OxyContin three times a day so I’m officially a junkie (it’s a living hell if I miss a dose; the withdrawal symptoms kick in hard and fast), and I take gabapentin for nerve damage caused by spinal tumors but that’s it other than weed. It’s absolutely criminal that we are made to believe that we can’t use it legally unless we live in a state that has “legalized” it. I live in Texas and UPS delivers my weed to my front door. No problem and there’s not a goddam thing that someone who doesn’t live in this body can do about it. And hang in there with us. Finding this sub has been so important for my mental health. Give us a try and see if it works for you too. ✌️❤️🫵Yeah. I’ve been there for a couple of weeks now. I’m having some luck with Iberogast. A lot of the digestive pain ends up being a gas thing but after all of the side effects from all of the stuff we’ve been through, the mind assumes it’s constipation. But no kidding brothers & sisters, the abdominal/ digestive stuff can be worse than the tumor pain (and they might be related). Don’t suffer in silence. ✌️❤️🫵✊Then don’t. I told four people: my two closest friends and two of my former law partners. I asked them all to keep it to themselves. Two did, two clearly didn’t and I know which two didn’t based on who else I heard from. I don’t think you should feel like you have to tell anyone who doesn’t absolutely need to know.",617,0,0,"['start', '👏👏👏i', '’', 'know', 'lingo', 'exactly', 'i', 'clear', 'cell', 'renal', 'carcinoma',

It’s typically found in older homes. Especially those with basements. You would need to contact the city or environmental protection for a test kit.Hello. I’m 28F stage 4 NSCLC with Atrx mutation. I got a Lobectomy done (LLL) as well as a Lung resection (LUL) You’re right cancer is unpredictable. I ended up on a clinical trial- after failure with chemo and immunotherapy. When the cancer progressed I had a Tumor ablation (Aliya- PEF ablation) performed. So far the tumor is shrinking! My best advice considering your young age and being that you’re considered relatively healthy; your best bet is to get everything and anything done while your body can still handle it. At least that’s how my doctors and I are going about my prognosisI’m a lot younger than your father 28F so recovery was pretty easy for me. I was initially diagnosed with stage 3A NSCLC now stage 4; and had a Lobectomy done. I’m asthmatic as well and I had an active actinomycosis infection in my lung during the surgery. I had repeated VATS procedures and another Lung resection surgery. I’m breathing better than I did when I was first diagnosed. Just make sure his asthma is well controlled with his meds and make sure he has painkillers post surgery incase he’s in pain. Feel free to message me if you have any questions!

734,Yourstrulysandy,"My mom (63) was diagnosed with stage 4 nsclc late last yr/early this yr by presenting to the ER with nausea and vomiting which we thought was from vertigo but it was from brain Mets causing severely low sodium. She did 15 sessions of whole brain radiation which removed the Mets. She has RET gene mutation and was given a 3-6 month prognosis if no gene target, and 1 yr if there is a gene to target, but since she had RET she used chemo pills Gavreto for 3 months then had progression and now she’s using Retevmo, she’s currently experiencing a lot of pain and basically bed bound too. We just reached our 8th month since diagnosis. There’s no easy way to navigate this, but there are lung cancer groups on Facebook with people experiencing very similar situations who can help guide you to the right direction with their experience.

741,[deleted],"I have been WAGING a battle against cancer for 9 years!Comment deleted by userYou have my blessings, I'd say you'll be fineShe never cared. Leave her at the curb. You have better battles worth fighting for.AML and secondary AML (arising from other bone marrow disorder or caused by treatments for other Cancer) have different outcome and survival rate. The outcome for secondary AML said to be not-so-good. And also OP's son already diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma. Reading from OP's post history, it is sure that OP's son is having a hard time regarding his health and been dealing with a bunch of medical issues. I can only imagine how hard it is. But I agree they should discuss with their son's medical team.Cut him off. He’s still a monkey of the past. He’s not human.Having support definitely would make things a little less stressful but unfortunately my family abandoned me when I was 16 so I've been on my own ever since. I'm homeless and don't have the funds to get food or water which probably makes things worse lol. I just try to ground myself by focusing on my senses and the things around me. I really hate complaining I just needed a little space to vent to anyone who would listen. I just hope I can figure everything out. Thank you for your kind comment.So…you have CLL, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma AND Paget’s Disease?some feel different effects from these things its trickyIt sounds like we have the same dad, my dad has literally said those exact same things too lmao. I would rather die than go through chemotherapy again personally, but I also believe that the after effects are equally as shitty in their own way. I have survivors guilt, chemo brain and a few other long term side effects and I have very bad days sometimes. Cancer affects you for the rest of your life and anybody who has never had it will never truly understand our pain and trauma. I believe chemo itself and the after effects are both the absolute worst. I also stopped believing in god the day I was diagnosed. I will not worship a god that gives kids cancer. Don't listen to anybody who has never gone through it, I love my dad but I know for a fact that god was not with me during that hell.Want a macaroon?I had anxiety before cancer so I have some experience of managing it in my daily life (including medication, narrative therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy). I have terrible ""scanxiety"" when going for scans and tests .I agree, my dad truly believes that since I've been in remission for so long now that it's never going to come back and I just look at him and say nothing. There's always a chance it could and I live with that fear everyday, I do appreciate his reassurance but it's just a fear I'm going to live with the rest of my life. My tumor was in my stomach and I had really bad stomach pain before I was diagnosed with cancer and now everytime my stomach hurts I think it's a tumor and I hate it. Living with constant paranoia is not fun. I'm very sorry to hear about your cancers too, I genuinely hope you stay cancer free for life nowI'm so sorry to hear that. No one deserves this god awful diease. I hope everything works out good for you and hey, I wonder why I survived too. Every other kid I knew has died and it's the saddest thing, just know that your not alone my friend. I wish you the best of luckI like thatAmazing!!Wow, you are hella strong for going through that 🥺 Congrats on being cancer free 🙂It takes time! I was 15 when I was diagnosed (same cancer), 16 when I finished treatment, and I didn’t feel “normal-ish” until about 19. My Dr told me: Damage to our bodies is easy to do, and it happens very quickly. Recovery is harder, and it’s slow. So give yourself twice as long to heal as the time it took to do the damage… or more! It gets better, I promise you!Also a Hodgkins Lymphoma survivor here (she 15 at diagnosis) and I feel weird about being a survivor, I feel like for a LONG time during and after chemo it defined who I was. The very definition of my existing was either cancer patient or cancer survivor. I’m about to be 32 and I’ve spent more years of my living life as a survivor than the 15 years before the cancer… and it kind of makes me mad. I don’t talk about it much anymore because there’s not much of a need to and I want my life to be defined by who I am in my soul, not on a cellular level. Hey y’all, none of us are alone! Cancer puts us in weird mental places, and that ok! 🫶I was diagnosed at 17. Next month marks 40 years for me. I too figured I wouldn't last long. They told me I might get 15-20 years. Here's some advice: Don't measure yourself by others. You have experienced a trauma that they haven't. You're also experiencing an ongoing trauma that is especially impacting given your age. More and more is being learned about the physical and mental late term effects. Depending on your location, there are resources to help, especially if you're a childhood survivor. Many ""Children's"" hospitals have programs specifically for survivors of all ages. I'm fortunate to have access to one. Many of the teaching hospitals also have programs. I struggle with after effects also. My psychiatrist daignosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder due to the trauma. (A good psychiatrist can help.) I've also been told I'll need a new heart valve soon on top of the four stents I have. And occasionally I feel like I've wasted too much time trying to be ""normal.' I've had a succesful career, but I can't have children and didn't want to adopt because the idea of possibly dying with a young child didn't appeal to me. But I digress. If you'd like, you can send me a message and I'll be happy to find the resources you need. Actually that goes for anyone on this sub. If you need an advocate to help you find what you need, PM me.Survivors guilt can be horrible. I didn’t think about it too much growing up but sometimes I can’t get it out of my head. Sometimes I get depressed and wonder if the world would be significantly different if I never made it. I’d love to talk with people that understand this better. That’s one of the reasons why I’m glad I found this sub.Your feelings are valid. Well said.You’re not alone in feeling like this! I’m about to turn a weird corner for myself and it’s a happy-sad feeling: I was 15 when I was diagnosed, and I’m about to round 16 years remission which means I’ll have spent more of my life as a cancer survivor than I ever spent as a normal kid. It’s like when women get married and someday have had their married last name longer than their maiden last name? I think it becomes more difficult to remember what life was like NOT as a survivor with every passing year. And it’s a weird ass feeling… grateful to be here, dealing with long term effects, frustrated with knowing I’ve been held back in certain aspects yet overwhelmed with pride at how far I’ve come at the same time. Bag of mixed nuts!! Salty nuts at that… You’re not alone!I’m sorry for your loss but I’m glad that you’re doing okay. My situation was weird. Nobody else in my family ever had cancer. They know which chromosomes or whatever we’re messed up but they never knew why.I am also a cancer who had cancerThat’s fun! Please post pictures if you do.Ooh! Can you post pictures?Ooh! This was my first one. Can you send me a picture when you get it?You might find more people with APL in r/leukemia. I had AML. I later got meningitis during my treatment and some of my doctors think that lead to my cognitive impairment. What’s weird is I don’t remember a life without post-cancer checkups. It’s weird having nostalgia for the hospital.I don't mean to be depressing, but many pf them never go away. In my case, they showed up well after I finished treatment. I had chemo and radiation back in the 80s. If you've had mantle radation you need a good cardiologist, and if you've had any radiotherapy at all, you need to watch your thyroid. Chronic fatigue is a part of it that I struggle with. I also have high blood pressure, four heart stents, a faulty valve and my muscles don't metabolize energy correctly. I aslo don't sleep well. Other than that, I'm doing okay.Comment removed by moderatorMy mom had a very similar diagnosis. Large right lung mass and a secondary mass pushing into her esophagus/vertebrate Radiation helped immensely with the mass that was pushing against her esophagus/back and it ultimately didn’t come back. One key thing to advocate for is pain relief. My mom was a trooper and I wish I was able to convince her to go on stronger pain relief sooner for her quality of life.",948,0,0,"['start', 'i', 'waging', 'battle', 'cancer', '9', 'yearscomment',

Then I had a routine physical and they noticed a high liver enzyme. It wasn't that high though, so no one was very concerned. But I had an ultrasound and MRI anyway and guess what?

770,ant_clip,"To echo and amplify what others have suggested, because you are so depressed, why not first talk to a therapist just to talk it all out before making a decision to stop. I also agree that talking to someone from hospice might be helpful so you have a sense of what that will be like. I decided to forgo treatment. I am stage 3/4 metastatic adenocarcinoma unknown primary (CUP). I was 67, diagnosed when it metastasized to my liver. After liver resection surgery, I was told 6 months to a year no treatment and maybe 3 or 4 with treatment. I elected no treatment. In addition to being older I also have stage 4 emphysema. Context is everything. My oncologist was very supportive with my decision. It is my life, my body, it was my decision. My friends and family understand, it took a few conversations with some but they get it and respect my decision. My oncologists were really wrong with their prognosis, I am an outlier and incredibly fortunate. Still here 4 years later, a couple of small mets in lymph nodes that are very slowly growing for now. I am so very sorry you are going through this and facing this decision. If you have any questions feel free to ask or even DM me.I will be doing MAID, I am not ready yet but at some level I can relate. There is a sense of dread that is hard to describe. I suspect when you are ready, you will know it deep in your soul. Preparing is not the same as doing, preparing gives you the option should the pain be too much. You don’t have to decide until the moment you take the meds. I wish you peace.My oncologist referred me to palliative care when I brought it up, that was how I got started with palliative. Palliative has talked to me in detail about how it works, what’s involved, how I would feel and of course referrals so when the time is right I know who to contact. Having that support is extremely helpful. Maybe skip the oncologist and talk to someone from palliative care. I am not yet at the 6 month mark, I am incredibly fortunate. I think of it as a safety net to spare me from the worst, not a contract. I might never need it, I might go quickly and quietly but it’s comforting to know it’s an option should I want it.It is your choice, it is your body, your life. I would just suggest give yourself the space to change your mind. I am not doing treatment. I see my oncologist every three months and have remained open to conversations. I wish you the best, and no you are not selfish.I know the feeling myself. I also know how it feels to be alone when going through it. I am stage 3/4 metastatic adenocarcinoma unknown primary, you aren't alone. What you do is you live, you are here today so for today you live. Your medical team will help you to navigate the treatment options or whatever is appropriate for you. A therapist can help you to navigate the emotional aspect of the journey.I am terminal on palliative, not yet ready for hospice. Palliative care is mostly about keeping me as pain free as possible. They have also helped me to redo all my end of life care documents, e.g. POLST. They gave me some info and resources regarding MAID. We do a telemed every 1-2 months where we talk about pain management, my weight, am I eating well, sleeping well, etc. They prescribe my liquid morphine and an anti-inflammatory med for something else I have unrelated to my cancer. I have found it helpful, but mostly it is reassuring knowing when it starts to get bad, I know who to call and they know me. Why not just ask your oncologist or their PA about it?I had a similar experience for a while, over time I adjusted as much as a person can. For me it was not a permanent new normal, but it does take time to process. You are in the worse leg of the journey, the lack of information can be torture. There is nothing wrong with talking to a therapist that specializes in cancer patients. Wish you the best for your appointment tomorrow. Getting past this first one will help.Good for you, no need to waste precious energy and sanity on someone like that. And you are right, better to do it alone than to fight that battle everyday.",408,0,0,"['start', 'to', 'echo', 'amplify', 'others', 'suggested', 'depressed', 'first', 'talk', 'therapist', 'talk', 'making', 'decision', 'stop', 'i', 'also', 'agree', 'talking', 'someone', 'hospice', 'might', 'helpful', 'sense', 'like', 'i', 'decided', 'forgo', 'treatment', 'i', 'stage', '34', 'metastatic', 'adenocarcinoma', 'unknown', 'primary', 'cup', 'i', '67', 'diagnosed', 'metastasized', 'liver', 'after', 'liver', 'resection', 'surgery', 'i', 'told', '6', 'months', 'year', 'treatment', 'maybe', '3', '4', 'treatment', 'i', 'elected', 'treatment', 'in', 'addition', 'older', 'i', 'also', 'stage', '4', 'emphysema', 'context', 'everything', 'my', 'oncologist', 'supportive', 'decision', 'it', 'life', 'body', 'decision', 'my', 'friends', 'family', 'understand', 'took', 'conversations', 'get', 'respect', 'decision', 'my', 'oncologists', 'really', 'wrong', 'prognosis', 'i', 'outlier', 'incredibly', 'fortunate', 'still', '4', 'years', 'later', 'couple', 'small', 'mets', 'lymph', 'nodes', 'slowly', 'growing', 'i', 'sorry', 'going', 'facing', 'decision', 'if', 'questions', 'feel', 'free', 'ask', 'even', 'dm', 'mei', 'maid', 'i', 'ready', 'yet', 'level', 'i', 'relate', 'there', 'sense', 'dread', 'hard', 'describe', 'i', 'suspect', 'ready', 'know', 'deep', 'soul', 'preparing', 'preparing', 'gives', 'option', 'pain', 'much', 'you', '’', 'decide', 'moment', 'take', 'meds', 'i', 'wish', 'peacemy', 'oncologist', 'referred', 'palliative', 'care', 'i', 'brought', 'i', 'got', 'started', 'palliative', 'palliative', 'talked', 'detail', 'works', '’', 'involved', 'i', 'would', 'feel', 'course', 'referrals', 'time', 'right', 'i', 'know', 'contact', 'having', 'support', 'extremely', 'helpful', 'maybe', 'skip', 'oncologist', 'talk', 'someone', 'palliative', 'care', 'i', 'yet', '6', 'month', 'mark', 'i', 'incredibly', 'fortunate', 'i', 'think', 'safety', 'net', 'spare', 'worst', 'contract', 'i', 'might', 'never', 'need', 'i', 'might', 'go', 'quickly', 'quietly', '’', 'comforting', 'know', '’', 'option', 'i', 'want', 'itit', 'choice', 'body', 'life', 'i', 'would', 'suggest', 'give', 'space', 'change', 'mind', 'i', 'treatment', 'i', 'see', 'oncologist', 'every', 'three', 'months', 'remained', 'open', 'conversations', 'i', 'wish', 'best', 'selfishi', 'know', 'feeling', 'i', 'also', 'know', 'feels', 'alone', 'going', 'i', 'stage', '34', 'metastatic', 'adenocarcinoma', 'unknown', 'primary', 'arent', 'alone', 'what', 'live', 'today', 'today', 'live', 'your', 'medical', 'team', 'help', 'navigate', 'treatment', 'options', 'whatever', 'appropriate', 'a', 'therapist', 'help', 'navigate', 'emotional', 'aspect', 'journeyi', 'terminal', 'palliative', 'yet', 'ready', 'hospice', 'palliative', 'care', 'mostly', 'keeping', 'pain', 'free', 'possible', 'they', 'also', 'helped', 'redo', 'end', 'life', 'care', 'documents', 'eg', 'polst', 'they', 'gave', 'info', 'resources', 'regarding', 'maid', 'we', 'telemed', 'every', '12', 'months', 'talk', 'pain', 'management', 'weight', 'i', 'eating', 'well', 'sleeping', 'well', 'etc', 'they', 'prescribe', 'liquid', 'morphine', 'antiinflammatory', 'med', 'something', 'else', 'i', 'unrelated', 'cancer', 'i', 'found', 'helpful', 'mostly', 'reassuring', 'knowing', 'starts', 'get', 'bad', 'i', 'know', 'call', 'know', 'why', 'ask', 'oncologist', 'pa', 'iti', 'similar', 'experience', 'time', 'i', 'adjusted', 'much', 'person', 'for', 'permanent', 'new', 'normal', 'take', 'time', 'process', 'you', 'worse', 'leg', 'journey', 'lack', 'information', 'torture', 'there', 'nothing', 'wrong', 'talking', 'therapist', 'specializes', 'cancer', 'patients', 'wish', 'best', 'appointment', 'tomorrow', 'getting', 'past', 'first', 'one', 'helpgood', 'need', 'waste', 'precious', 'energy', 'sanity', 'someone', 'like', 'and', 'right', 'better', 'alone', 'fight', 'battle', 'everyday', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,['Surgery'],Unable to specify
777,bdpna,"Wow, what a fantastic answer. So sorry to hear about your mom as well. That has to be very stressful to do all that traveling and be so far away but wow, what a fantastic kid you are. Unfortunately, my dad has not been sleeping much at night since getting the lung cancer. The primary tumor is so close to his esophagus that he has constant phlegm that is exacerbated when he tries to lay horizontal. Anything but sitting up right in the chair and he has problems. It has been really hard to watch. So maybe one positive side effect if he gets tired enough is that he will actually get real sleep. Much like your mom, my dad was celebrating losing weight before his diagnosis. Since then he has been trying to eat, but it has been a real struggle. Unfortunately, we haven’t found much that he enjoys as everything is tasteless and struggle to put down with no desire. I’m a little concerned about this so will continue to do my best to advocate that he eat even when it is the last thing on his mind. Thanks so much for that. My dad sounds a lot like your mom and his doctor meetings. I have been in every single meeting and the one asking most of the questions. My dad‘s doctor is also a little older and seems to have the clinical approach, but not really a lot of additional bedside manner. My dad doesn’t mind as he is the same way. I prefer a little more detail from the doctor and not the feeling like he’s rushing to get to the next patient or the next thing.that said, I’m pretty well schooled on what my dad has, at least more than I was a month ago. I sure do ask a lot of questions and hope to continue to ask the right ones when given the opportunity. Your mom is very lucky to have your dad. I do wish someone could always be there with him, but given him my sister’s family commitments and my work commitments that is just not a practical thing right now. We are going to do our best to be there in person as much as possible and via technology every single day. My very best wishes to you and your family during this difficult time.Thanks for the reply, my best wishes to you and your Mom in this rough time. It sure has been a stressful summer.Wow sounds like she is tolerating very well! The eating and movement are big things. My dad struggles in both now so hoping the treatment may change that for him at least during the non tired days. Wishing Continued good progress to your mom!!!Well, the day is here. I'll try and keep a journal here or start a new post if it feels more helpful. My sister is taking him to the first treatment today and we are alternating. I'll be spending several days living with him after he gets home today. From what we hear the first day and night are not bad but anywhere up to ""day 5"" (I assume treatment counts as ""day 1"") can be the worst of it, so I want to be there. Since he lives an hour away from each of us but wants to be home, this was our best plan we could devise. We are thankful for the schedule of 3 weeks between treatments though realize this means he'll be getting a lot today, so we are hoping for the best but ready for the worst with side effects. I'll share that stuff here when I get a chance, just hoping that we are ready. Ironically (probably by design) Dad had the best 2 days since diagnosis this week, the palliative radiation given to the lung tumor finally got his cough and phlegm under control, took 2 more weeks past the last treatment to finally start giving results, so it is true that radiation keeps working many weeks or even months (TBD?) after it ends. Of course, after those good 2 days he's right back into the dumps with the chemo starting today. Our biggest concerns are if he will have issues with bathroom activities (that has been a struggle between constipation and the other extreme) and his weight loss continues at about 3 pounds per week due to lack of appetite. We're expecting him to mostly just want to sleep and be inactive during the first week of each chemo cycle. So it will be a challenge to get him to drink and eat if he is mostly sleeping. And then we are of course hopeful to avoid the nausea. I will post more when I can in the days ahead, any feedback always helpful. Also hoping this post can be useful to any others down the road who are going through a similar medicine combo.As promised here's an update. We are on day 5 after the first infusion. Figure I can leave this all here, helpful to those who may find it later, as other posts on history of treatments have helped us to get ready. So due to the steroid he had a great day at treatment, they treated him well with meds and comfort in a massage chair and snacks. He enjoyed the day very much and ""loved"" chemo. Ha! He had a huge energy burst that lasted the next 2-3 days after treatment due to steroids in the IV as well as the pills. We are on day 5 now and this is the start of the ""crash"". I will note the palliative radiation to his primary in his chest finally started to have positive effects just before the chemo which helped resolve his cough and appetite somewhat. So that plus the steroids, he has been able to return to bed to sleep and eating/drinking while nowhere near regular levels did increase. He tried some normal non-sugar food and was able to get some down also was able to drink way more fluids after chemo. Which I hope will help. Top two issues on day 5, constipation which has been a problem for a while now, we are trying to work on it via a once daily stool softener as well as a laxative pill. We will talk to the docs if these OTC meds do not work. Second side effect started setting in yesterday that is getting worse today is muscle pain and some neuropathy. He is having some trouble walking and having to be VERY careful. Muscle pain was so bad he was unable to sleep last night. We are going to try and manage with OTC tylenol but if it gets no better or worse with the pain and inability to sleep we'll talk to the doc. That's where we are on day 5. My hope is that we have a few rough days and then he gets some better more normal days in the 21 day cycle. Then it starts all over again for at least 5 more treatments. Will try and keep this post updated. As always welcome any comments or questions.More updates, again for anyone interested who finds this thread later or anyone with questions or comments now. Dad had second infusion on Friday, this time added Zometa for bone strengthening, the Keytruda, The Taxol (a 3 hour infusion) and the Carboplatin. The taxol is the most brutal of the bunch from what I am reading, with the carboplatin not far behind. Hair loss began about 2 weeks in, still some hair at week 3 but lots falling out as we start the second infusion at 21 days. Infusion days are easy due to steroid given during the process. The mediport worked well. During his nadir visit (halfway between first and second chemo) the white blood cell count was low as well as hemoglobin, came up in time for the second infusion. Doctor said something about needing a blood transfusion if it gets worse future times. Doctor also said he wants to CT scan the cancer areas after the 3rd treatment (9-10 weeks after first chemo) to check progress, since we are not yet seeing any signs of improvement (although I am unsure if we are supposed to, this soon either). Dad continues to have better days than others, big side effects are the following: Sleep disrupted, he sleeps when he can, often an hour here and there throughout the day, thus is not ready for bed at night and is often up half of the night. Cannot sleep on a bed but somehow can sleep on a recliner for an hour, and on a couch on his side for a few hours. We are not sure why this is. Appetite remains awful as ever, except on chemo infusion day when the steroid makes him more hungry and briefly improves taste. Otherwise most food has the wet cardboard sensation and his body rejects swallowing it, thus, eating very little and strength is very low, walking short distances has become a challenge from lack of strength as well as being out of breath The palliative radiation did cure his blood and mucous cough but the cough did return in a more dry fashion here and there for now. The lung was the primary so I guess this is the way it will be,. Constipation, rock hard stools for the first days / week after a chemo infusion. Trying to start stool softeners to manage. Neuropathy in hands fingers is pretty bothersome, also was in feet a bit, doc says Taxol causes this and lowered the dose a bit. Extreme fatigue and low feeling after the steroid pills stop being taken around day 5/6. No nausea at this point which we are at least thankful for. Fairly few words during the low days, on the high days, a lot more talking or communication, often with some repeated stuff or brain fog which may be due to some of the meds the palliative team provided to try and stimulate appetite or promote sleep (but do not seem to be working). Aggression or argumentative state can be a mix, less so on high days / steroid time, more energy and movement but often frantic or erratic. During low days, very quiet and mean. MAJOR pain in his tailbone which doc thinks is a pressure sore due to constant time in chair, not broken open yet but skin is thin there so we have concerns. Not managing with any pain meds other than tylenol which does not work. He did say pain went away after starting steroids. So it likely will return in a few days. That's about where we are at here at the three week mark. Next week, we expect the big crash and then have another Nadir visit to check his bloodwork, and an appointment with palliative care. I may ask for medical THC gummies which are approved in this state, before we move to any opioid type stuff. No other plans right now other than the horrible wait for scans after the 3rd chemo, from being here I know to expect the worst, hope for the best, but am ready for any outcome and then the doc's recommendations. Any questions let me know. I can try to answer.",1012,0,0,"['start', 'wow', 'fantastic', 'answer', 'so', 'sorry', 'hear', 'mom', 'well', 'that', 'stressful', 'traveling', 'far', 'away', 'wow', 'fantastic', 'kid',

791,briarwren,"I'm so sorry, and my thoughts are with you. This is normal, although I know it's incredibly hard waiting at first. Just be there for your mother to support her as well as possible, ensure there is someone to act as a scribe at her appointments, and don't bother with Dr. Google. You don't have enough info, and you'll only overwhelm yourself with the numbers. I speak from both sides of the fence. My mother has Stage IV small cell), and we found out completely by accident early last year when it metastasized to her brain and landed her in the ER. She had had no symptoms. We weren't shocked per se about the cancer itself since she's smoked for over 50 years, and my grandmother also had lung cancer. What we were shocked about was that it was such a late stage with no discernible symptoms. She had brain surgery and radiation to treat what was left in the brain and then began immunotherapy Optiva and Yrvoy. They moved fast, but I think she only had her brain surgery as quickly as she did because it was life-threatening. It's been 15 months, and she's doing well, although still on the Optiva. I saw her newest scan compared with the original one recently. The bit still left in her brain is ""dead,"" her other mets are gone, and the lung mass is demonstratively smaller with none of the junk it was originally surrounded with. When it gets a bit smaller, her doctor is planning more targeted radiation. Myself however, am a completely different story. We discovered I have Stage IV colon cancer completely by accident just after I turned 40. I also landed in the ER with pain they thought at first was appendicitis; if only! That was early December, and I didn't begin treatment until February. There is no colon cancer anywhere in my family. I was super healthy. I ate well, rarely drank, didn't smoke, and regularly walked 100+ miles a month with my dog. I had absolutely no symptoms that would have caught my doctor's attention enough to call for an early colonoscopy. I did have a few small ones, but nothing abnormal for my age group that wasn't typically easily cared for, such as perhaps taking a bit more fiber for constipation. I'm almost three years on and am doing reasonably well. My scans are clear, and I find out Thursday if I can suspend my chemo again after a recurrence, so fingers crossed.I'm so sorry. My thoughts are with you and yours, and the candles are lit. My mom is similar; brain mets with small cell lung cancer. We found out a year ago the beginning of May. She had a fast growing tumor that was barely a month old but was causing immense pain. At the time, she'd been fighting to schedule spinal surgery for degenerative disk disease. She was ignoring the pain and not letting us know how bad it actually was. I live almost two hours away, so she was able to play it off over the phone, but my SIL stopped by and managed to bully my strong-willed mother to the ER, which shows how bad it was. She was placed on meds and kept under observation to control the growth, had brain surgery a couple of weeks later, and they were able to remove the vast majority of it. Apparently, it was a close thing. She didn't have a stroke, but she could have, and the doctor said if she hadn't come in when she did, she would be gone. She had several radiation sessions for her brain, got her port, and then healed a bit before beginning her immunotherapy. She was on Optivo and Yrvoy every two weeks (treatments alternated between one and both), although recently, it's just Optivo since her doctor is happy with her current scans. I was with her when he compared the very first lung scan to her most recent one. It was demonstratively smaller and had none of the original junk around it. The doctor said when it reduced by half? (can't recall exactly) again, he would do targeted radiation. The tiny bit left in her head is still dead and not growing, and the other mets are gone.",395,0,0,"['start', 'im', 'sorry', 'thoughts', 'this', 'normal', 'although', 'i', 'know', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'waiting', 'first', 'just', 'mother', 'support', 'well', 'possible', 'ensure', 'someone', 'act', 'scribe', 'appointments', 'dont', 'bother', 'dr', 'google', 'you', 'dont', 'enough', 'info', 'youll', 'overwhelm', 'numbers', 'i', 'speak', 'sides', 'fence', 'my', 'mother', 'stage', 'iv', 'small', 'cell', 'found', 'completely', 'accident', 'early', 'last', 'year', 'metastasized', 'brain', 'landed', 'er', 'she', 'symptoms', 'we', 'werent', 'shocked', 'per', 'se', 'cancer', 'since', 'shes', 'smoked', '50', 'years', 'grandmother', 'also', 'lung', 'cancer', 'what', 'shocked', 'late', 'stage', 'discernible', 'symptoms', 'she', 'brain', 'surgery', 'radiation', 'treat', 'left', 'brain', 'began', 'immunotherapy', 'optiva', 'yrvoy', 'they', 'moved', 'fast', 'i', 'think', 'brain', 'surgery', 'quickly', 'lifethreatening', 'its', '15', 'months', 'shes', 'well', 'although', 'still', 'optiva', 'i', 'saw', 'newest', 'scan', 'compared', 'original', 'one', 'recently', 'the', 'bit', 'still', 'left', 'brain', 'dead', 'mets', 'gone', 'lung', 'mass', 'demonstratively', 'smaller', 'none', 'junk', 'originally', 'surrounded', 'when', 'gets', 'bit', 'smaller', 'doctor', 'planning', 'targeted', 'radiation', 'myself', 'however', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'we', 'discovered', 'i', 'stage', 'iv', 'colon', 'cancer', 'completely', 'accident', 'i', 'turned', '40', 'i', 'also', 'landed', 'er', 'pain', 'thought', 'first', 'appendicitis', 'that', 'early', 'december', 'i', 'didnt', 'begin', 'treatment', 'february', 'there', 'colon', 'cancer', 'anywhere', 'family', 'i', 'super', 'healthy', 'i', 'ate', 'well', 'rarely', 'drank', 'didnt', 'smoke', 'regularly', 'walked', '100', 'miles', 'month', 'dog', 'i', 'absolutely', 'symptoms', 'would', 'caught', 'doctors', 'attention', 'enough', 'call', 'early', 'colonoscopy', 'i', 'small', 'ones', 'nothing', 'abnormal', 'age', 'group', 'wasnt', 'typically', 'easily', 'cared', 'perhaps', 'taking', 'bit', 'fiber', 'constipation', 'im', 'almost', 'three', 'years', 'reasonably', 'well', 'my', 'scans', 'clear', 'i', 'find', 'thursday', 'i', 'suspend', 'chemo', 'recurrence', 'fingers', 'crossedim', 'sorry', 'my', 'thoughts', 'candles', 'lit', 'my', 'mom', 'similar', 'brain', 'mets', 'small', 'cell', 'lung', 'cancer', 'we', 'found', 'year', 'ago', 'beginning', 'may', 'she', 'fast', 'growing', 'tumor', 'barely', 'month', 'old', 'causing', 'immense', 'pain', 'at', 'time', 'shed', 'fighting', 'schedule', 'spinal', 'surgery', 'degenerative', 'disk', 'disease', 'she', 'ignoring', 'pain', 'letting', 'us', 'know', 'bad', 'actually', 'i', 'live', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'away', 'able', 'play', 'phone', 'sil', 'stopped', 'managed', 'bully', 'strongwilled', 'mother', 'er', 'shows', 'bad', 'she', 'placed', 'meds', 'kept', 'observation', 'control', 'growth', 'brain', 'surgery', 'couple', 'weeks', 'later', 'able', 'remove', 'vast', 'majority', 'apparently', 'close', 'thing', 'she', 'didnt', 'stroke', 'could', 'doctor', 'said', 'hadnt', 'come', 'would', 'gone', 'she', 'several', 'radiation', 'sessions', 'brain', 'got', 'port', 'healed', 'bit', 'beginning', 'immunotherapy', 'she', 'optivo', 'yrvoy', 'every', 'two', 'weeks', 'treatments', 'alternated', 'one', 'although', 'recently', 'optivo', 'since', 'doctor', 'happy', 'current', 'scans', 'i', 'compared', 'first', 'lung', 'scan', 'recent', 'one', 'it', 'demonstratively', 'smaller', 'none', 'original', 'junk', 'around', 'the', 'doctor', 'said', 'reduced', 'half', 'cant', 'recall', 'exactly', 'would', 'targeted', 'radiation', 'the', 'tiny', 'bit', 'left', 'head', 'still', 'dead', 'growing', 'mets', 'gone', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,"['pain', 'chronic constipation']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Chemotherapy', 'Targeted Therapy', 'Radiation Therapy']",carcinoma

813,colbsk1,"First, I want to express how deeply sorry I am for what you and your wife are going through. She is incredibly fortunate to have your support during this time. What you're experiencing reminds me of the last 77 days of my mother's life. She was diagnosed with small cell carcinoma in May of 2024 and passed away on August 10th 2024. Her cancer was extremely aggressive, partly due to her heavy smoking and drinking. Despite the installation of a chemo port, she chose not to undergo chemotherapy, opting instead to avoid the side effects and spend her remaining days with some semblance of quality. In her final days: On August 8th, around 2:30 p.m., my mother decided to lie down for a nap. That was the last time she got out of bed. She was still eating, talking, and using the bathroom, but as the week progressed, she ate less, spoke less, and slept more. On August 10th, her final day, my dad reported that at 1:30 a.m., my mom woke him by hitting him and said, ""Let's go."" When he asked where, she didn’t respond, and they both went back to sleep. It seemed to me that this was a brief burst of energy before her final moments. In her last hours: At 4:30 a.m. on August 10th, my dad was awakened by labored breathing followed by the death rattle. By 6:45 a.m., she was grinding her teeth, a sign of possible pain, so she was given morphine. Her eyes were half-open, without movement, and her pupils were unresponsive to light. When I arrived around 10:15 a.m., she appeared lifeless, though her chest still rose and fell weakly. The sound of mucus and saliva with her shallow breaths was unsettling. Her legs were purple, her feet moved sporadically, and her eyes were glassy. I tried to get a response by making eye contact, squeezing her hand, and tickling her feet, but there was no reaction. I did manage to get a slight groan when I massaged her shoulder. Holding her hand, it grew cold rapidly. I left briefly to speak with my dad, and upon returning, I found her chest no longer moving and the rattling sound had stopped. It was clear that she had passed away. The time was 3:15p.m., the same time I was born oddly enough. I hope sharing this helps in some way. If not, that's okay too. Writing about it has been a form of solace for me, as I don’t keep a diary or journal. Keep fighting, and know that my thoughts are with you and your wife.

844,erinmarie777,"That’s very good advice and thank you for sharing your experience. It’s very understandable why you feel angry. I have distrust in many doctors myself. I’m sorry you have to experience such a traumatic disease. I’m glad you feel hopeful with the immunotherapy, and hope it smacks down all the pests. Sending healing thoughts. I’m angry for all the people who have been told not to worry about it when their bodies were giving them so many signals, and then turned out that they had cancer. There’s so many young people who have made videos about this story of being ignored, even for years, and then finally getting diagnosed. Why do doctors think they are so good at psychology? It makes me angry. They should do more tests but they don’t want to beg the insurance for “approval” because it’s so time consuming. I’ve heard them discussing this. So instead they seem to like to tell too many people that it’s all in their heads. Women get told that far too often. And black women are more likely to be ignored and die after childbirth because their complaints are ignored too often. We need to work harder on making this world a better place for everyone. It’s not nice sometimes in ways that are definitely wrong, but also just very unnecessary. Doctors need more time with patients and need to be allowed to do more testing. It shouldn’t take years to get an MRI when people have significant problems, they don’t know what it is causing it, but nothing works. I think we need more diagnostic specialists who can help people with finding out what is going wrong with them. Let’s get rid of insurance companies dictating how much time doctors can take and what tests they can do. Maybe the business model is corrupted too. Maybe they just want us coming back several times before ordering tests.No such thing when it’s cancer. xThat was a good question. You have gone through so much. I have always wondered what the trigger was the first time people sought medical attention. From what I’ve seen, people wait and see, and don’t go to a doctor unless they feel like they really have to.I know you don’t really want to discuss your marriage here, but I do feel shocked she actually said she didn’t care about your scan or your scan anxiety and then she had such a non-response to the news of the spot. That behavior suggests that she’s resentful about something that she hasn’t verbally expressed yet? I don’t know. I just hope she can look within herself and figure herself out and open up about why she wasn’t feeling empathetic to your emotions. You certainly deserve empathy and support. It’s so hard and so stressful to worry about it. Take a deep breath and tell yourself you will “wait and see”. Worry won’t help you, but I am so sorry you may have to beat back cancer again. I really hope they are wrong.I think saying “everything will be okay” is something that can feel comforting at times even when it’s probably not true. I’m so sorry for your son and you and your family. Maybe because your son was already thinking about stopping treatment, in some ways, he will take this as his permission to just enjoy the rest of his life as long as he can. Idk. It’s so hard for me to know what to say to you. I’m just very sorry that you have been given such bad news and have to tell him this awful news.If you don’t want to hurt her feelings, you can say you will look at it later, but right now what you need most from her is to please talk about anything else to distract you because you need a break. Then change the subject by asking about her family, her activities, her feelings, etc. Hopefully she will want to support you by respecting your needs.My heart really hurts for you and for all the cancer patients who haven’t been supported like they all need and deserve. I’m just blown away sometimes by how some parents treat their grown children. I rcan’t stop thinking about my own grown children or my grandchildren. Their health and happiness means the world to me. I always try to help in ways I can and as much as I can because I know how hard life can be, and I brought them into this life. Parents need to understand how important they are to their children, and how that continues long after they are grown. I always wonder how these uncaring neglectful parents were raised. What were their childhoods like? In my case I was very neglected as a child. My mother never expressed love or affection. She really rarely spoke. I got a hug from her for the first time in my life when I was 30. She hugged me and said “take care of yourself” when I was leaving (after I paid her a rare visit). I trembled for an hour. I know that both my parents came from large families and were children in the Great Depression. Their parents had no time for them, both working constantly. Still not enough to go around. My parents were both moody and angry people who never healed from their bad childhood and were never healthy as adults. My dad became an angry abusive “functioning alcoholic” who cheated on my mom, and my mom was chronically anxious and depressed. When I was growing up, I vowed that I would shower my children with love and affection, and help them every way I could. As an adult I have worked hard to process my past, and to heal. I believe “Know Thyself” is the best advice for anyone. It is so important to be aware and mindful of your own weaknesses and strengths and where they come from, and to work on yourself every day. We can’t always control our emotions but we can control our actions. Whether you speak to your parents again or not, seek healing, find some kind of understanding if possible, and work towards being at peace within yourself. The most important thing is not to pass your unhealed pain from your wounds onto the next generation. Gabor Mate has some good books and interviews about healing from childhood trauma on YouTube. I’m so glad they caught your cancer early and you have a good chance to reach remission. Can’t tell you how much I wish that was true for my son. He has glioblastoma and it’s the worst nightmare to worry about his chances for survival for 5 years.I feel so sorry for people who are dating these days. I’ve heard so many crazy stories about guys who start out okay but turn into complete weirdos on dates. But dating after being diagnosed with cancer might be a real trip for you I’m afraid. Even friends and family can say the wrong things and give ridiculous advice sometimes. I love your self confidence. Keep smiling. Keep venting your experiences. I hope you don’t meet too many more toads before you find someone who was raised well and can become a trustworthy best friend and a real supporter for you. You deserve that. Everyone does.Writing about this experience might be therapeutic for you to help you process your emotions. I think your fiancé, family, and friends would appreciate it when you’re gone. (You could also make videos for them). My son has an incurable cancer and he recommended a book called “The Last Lecture”. It was written by a professor who was terminally ill. He has since passed. My son is a philosophy professor and he has been studying the philosophy of “Stocism” and says it’s helpful for him. I have also found reading about Stocism helpful for myself. I am struggling with accepting this terrible reality that I am losing my first child. I’m just trying to remember that when we’re born, no one ever knows when they are going to die or how they will die. The only thing that is certain about life is that everyone does die. We are just pretending that everyone gets to live a long life because most of us live in too much denial to face the reality that it can happen any time and any day. We need to work harder on that in our culture. We have too much denial about a lot of issues. My heart goes out to you. I’m so sorry. You are so young. Life feels so unfair sometimes.",816,0,0,"['start', 'that', '’', 'good', 'advice', 'thank', 'sharing', 'experience', 'it', '’', 'understandable', 'feel', 'angry', 'i', 'distrust', 'many', 'doctors',

852,feathernose,"I’m so sorry.. i went through excruciating pain from tumors in my spine too, it’s the worst pain i’ve ever felt and also felt i couldn’t live long with that kind of pain. Is it possible for you to find another oncologist? Second time radiation is sometimes possible, as well as another chemo, and surgery. It took me 3 surgeries (because it grew back) and maybe more in the future. There have to be doctors willing to look out of the box and willing to help you. There are also medications for these kinds of pain. Your doctors should really be more helpful. Please stand up for yourself and do everything you can! Sometimes doctors need a reality check. It took me initially years before my GP took my pain seriously. They were almost too late. Please look out for yourself. And seek for help <3 maybe all hope is not lost.Oh is it like ‘eat a dozen of apricot seeds a day’ or ‘take a vitamin C overdose daily’? If yes, are we family?Good point. I do believe your ‘healthcare team’ aka your doctors, should come up with a plan to make sure you have the best quality of life as possible. This should possibly include counseling, help to keep your house clean and livable, medications to ease any pain or discomfort.. this last stage in life should be as comfortable as possible. Do you have friends and family around that can help? I believe it might difficult to reach out to your doctors and friends and family, but please do it. You deserve the best. Do not worry about being a burden (apologies for the possible assumption, i receive palliative care and i do feel like a burden but i hope you feel better), it’s important to receive love and care. I really hope you will enjoy life to the fullest while it lasts. And i genuinely hope you’re in not too much pain. Big hugs from a stranger on the internet! 🫂At first, the stress really got to him. And me. It was very hard. He didnt choose to be with someone who has cancer, right? We had our issues but every time we pushed on through. He took care of me. I took care of him whenever i had tiny bit of energy left. We had 1 or 2 moments where we almost broke up. It was hard for both of us. It was 6 years ago - after treatment the cancer came back 2 years later. Treatment again. Guess what? 2 years later the cancer came back AGAIN. Finished surgery and chemo a few months ago. Its still hard sometimes because the relationship feels unbalanced because he has much more energy than me. But he is okay with that. He takes care for me and before my chemo he told me he really wanted to fight this battle together as a team. So it took us some years to find a way to manage our lives together and still be happy and have fun together. We now focus on the good moments together, building a lot of good memories. If you wanna talk i'm here for you.No new perspective on life, sorry. When my cancer got malignant i was 28 and i’m 34 now and finished my 12th chemo (after 3 surgeries and 30 rounds of radiation) a few months ago. Sadly no, it did not gave me a new perspective on life, apart from the fact i need to sign a will, for when the cancer kills me. Dating? That has been very very hard. Maybe because my self esteem is crap after all treatments because my body looks like a 50 year old, but maybe because guys just don’t want to date a woman with cancer. I don’t know. I don’t want to discourage you. Live your life, do what makes your happy, date if you have any libido left, do everything you want. This is the only life you get <3I know how you feel. My last chemo was in march, and i’m just starting to feel better now, for a bit. I’ve been pretty depressed because the chemo did more to my body than i thought. Good chance I’m infertile at age 34 now. My hormones not balanced. You don’t have to be happy, cancer sucks and youbhave the right to feel shitty about it even after finishing your last round of chemo. Chances of recurrence are always there and you will have to carry that with you. But you will find a way to manage. Keep yourself busy, do things that make you happy.

856,frostbike,"Great info in this comment. I was diagnosed last year and started chemo after my biopsy confirmed it was cancer but before we had the genetic testing results. The genetic tests revealed that I have an ALK mutation (similar to the EGFR mentioned) and I started taking alectinib. Chemo did nothing to stop my progression, but alectinib has been wonderful. So definitely make sure they do the genetic testing. Also, I very much agree with the recommendation not to read survival stats online. For the first six months or so I only used google to look up words and concepts I didn’t understand from radiology reports and doctor visits.Great news!As others have said, get the biomarker testing done. I was diagnosed last fall, stage 4 with mets in multiple bones and lymph nodes. Within a couple months of the diagnosis I lost 25 pounds, couldn’t walk without a cane (and a lot of pain), and my main tumor grew so fast it was pressing against the blood vessels that supply my heart, which resulted in a 3 day hospital stay. I have an ALK mutation, and have been doing targeted therapy for 8 months. I can walk and do most daily activities now. I’m still dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath, but it’s a 180 degree turnaround from where I was.

868,halfakoala,"Ask his doctor for food supplements, sometimes not much you can do if they don't eat. There are food supplements, made in sterile environment and uht packed. Similar to baby formula or protein milkshakes. They don't have much of a taste, some flavors like strawberry, banana or vanilla. Good luck with your dad's treatment.My heart goes out to you. I have been through pretty much the same, my dad had stage 4 lung cancer and doctors told me he has 6 months to a year left to live. His appetite was good until the last week, he had trouble breathing and standing for a minute was hard for him. He had taken two rounds of chemo but never had nausea or lost his appetite. On his last week, he started to get nausea and he threw up everything he ate. On a Friday, he went into ICU, they told me I couldn't see him until Monday due to not having enough personnel on call for weekends, and at 3am on Monday the hospital called me. Till that call, I still had hoped to see him on Monday. My advice to you is, Just stay with her. You may never be able to guess the time so spend as much time as you can with her. I'm sorry you are going through this.Mom(65) had the same surgery, she had problems with her kidneys so all pain relief they gave her was some paracetamol. After the surgery, she walked a lot on the hospital corridors, her doctors told her to blow baloons and cough a lot to expand her lungs and prevent liquid built up in her lungs. She had a slight break on one of her ribs and powered through with only Paracetamol. She had x-rays twice a day to examine the lung capacity. Everything went OK and she was sent home in 5 days. She had 3 sessions of preventative chemo. They monitor her now every 3 months with CT scans and MRIs.Her lung have expanded beautifully, and she has less problem breathing and more energy now that she had to quit smoking.

When we don't have much experience with cancer we are used to think that stage 4 is the end, but even in the end there is plenty of things to do. Some patients even with mets can live to 3 years. I have seen one that even wrote a book ! She had mets in the liver, terminal cancer, and did dance classes. Besides that, nowadays palliative care is recommended to everyone who has a disease that threatens the life, even when it's still treatment available. Palliative care helps us to understand death and how to bring comfort for our loved ones. They teach us how to manage the physical pain of our loved ones, how to prepare them and how to enjoy every minute that we have left. I know it's hard but you have to try. Don't cancel your flight. She will need you there. A lot of patients said that they don't want their families, because they are afraid of family gets desperate and make things worst. But deep down, they need their family. Also, if you can, go see her now. She may be going, but even when we are going, there is plenty things to do. You can talk to her, you can watch movies with her and do little things that she likes. Try to act normal around her. Make her smile. I think that studying palliative care will help you a lot to understand what to do and how to manage the situation with your mother. (it helps me with my dad, he has mets in his lungs) This book ""Death is a day that worth living"" helped me a lot. I hope it will help you too.I am so sorry for your lost. My dad is in treatment for 5 years. Now he has a lot of mets, and I am his care giver too. He's not dead, but day after day he gets worse and I know that it's time to say goodbye. I didn't have family to help me (only my mom who does not get along with my dad), my friends all disappeared because I was not fun anymore and no one wants to talk about death. People avoid thinking about death, because they think that avoiding this death doesn't exist. So I think I understand how you must be felling (I don't have anyone, just my mom). I know it's hard, specially when we are alone. Our parents are our best friends (my dad is my whole world, and I think your mother it was your whole world too). And no one wants to live without our best friends. Life looses its colors, specially when we are young (I am 22, so l get it how you must be feeling). But something that I've learned studying palliative care all those years is that we never lost the one we loved. Even when they are not here, they will always be in our heart and in our memories. Our parents literally made us, they are in our DNA, they are in our qualities and also in our defaults.Your mother may be not be here physically, but she is inside you. You are her legacy. And you should live to pass forward her qualities, to be a strong and amazing human being. Don't be the person who thinks that now that your person is gone, everything is over. It's not. Your mother is still alive in your heart and inside you. She is alive when you are strong, she will be alive when you conquer things (because everything you will conqu it's because of the qualities that she taught you). She is alive when you listen her favorite song, and when you do thinas that she likes. Thinking this wav helps me a lot with my dad. I know that when he goes, he will always be inside me. He will be inside me when I watch car races (because he always loved car races). He is inside me when I learn Italian (he always wanted to learn how to speak Italian), when I listen 80's songs (He always loved 80's band, and I listen them all the time) and when I persist in my goals (he created me to be fighter and not the person who just does not have an opinion). Doing things that he likes, breathing the air that he wanted me to breathe, help me to realize that he will always live inside me. Maybe this will help you to keep your mom always around. I also learn in palliative care that when your person dies, your life will never be the same, but this doesn't mean that will always be unhappy. because that is not what our loved ones would want. Your mother would want that you would be happy. That you would go back to school and made your life, build new projects (a career, or having a family). That you fulfill your life with other happiness. I know it's hard to think about new projects when literally your whole world fell apart, but with time, you will rebuild your life and make an extraordinary life. You are stronger than most people. A lot of kids in your place would just give up, they couldn't stand give u school and being the care giver, but you didn't. Anc. is amazing. You will have the strength to make a new life and make your mother proud (and alive inside you). Besides that, the book Death is a day worths living, helped me a lot. I think you should read, and try counseling, grief therapy (individual or in group) it's helpful too. Talking to a psychologist helps you to understand your grief and move on with your life. If you need someone to talk to, please feel free to send me a DM.",537,0,0,"['start', 'i', 'sorry', 'mom', 'i', 'think', 'need', 'prepared', 'losing', 'its', 'easy', 'bring', 'comfort', 'you',

912,kitkatofthunder,"I’m sorry. That is really disgusting. I work with an amazing spine surgeon who is also trained in oncology. His approach is if we can’t explain something we never ignore it. Either we run more tests, imaging, or provide a referral to a specialty that might have more insight. 1. With your symptoms they should have provided you with a referral to neurology if they couldn’t find anything. 2. We can never say to anyone their symptoms are nothing. If they continue to follow-through with multiple appointments, tests, exams it means the symptoms are bothering them significantly. Each specialty has a very narrow perspective on the entirety of medicine, refer until you find it and continue follow-up to see if anything progresses, usually it doesn’t take long. 3. I hate to say it, but it doesn’t affect us at all to send for advanced imaging. It takes a few seconds for the order and if there is nothing it takes 2 minutes to read the images. If insurance fights, it sucks, but we wait 6 weeks then we send it again saying they continue to have pain and it will be approved. Denying imaging is just lazy. The only concern for imaging is sometimes we find things that are ambiguous and require further observation or tests.I’m so sorry. I have treated one patient with an active newly diagnosed pheochromocytoma and currently regularly see a second patient with pheochromocytoma in remission to evaluate for any progression of the disease. At this point in time, I can say both are alive. I say this from the perspective of orthopedic spine surgery, that being said, only 18 people in history of medical studies have had a pheochromocytoma with metastasis to the spine, so I have a very small study base to go off of when discussing treatment for patients. For patients in general, my best recommendation is going to a major facility like Sloan Kettering where the physicians actually see these things regularly. Pheochromocytoma, while rare, occur in about 0.8 in 100,000 people. There are around 333 million people in the US, these major facilities have regular interactions with these cancers. With you wanting to fight and having concerns for the experience of your physician on this particular cancer, I recommend a tertiary facility. Additionally, as you have a young son genetic testing should also be performed this cancer can be associated with some rare genetic conditions, if I had a child, I would want to make sure. While radiation can be variable with pheochromocytoma, I would have hope for chemotherapy. The 5 year survival rate for a pheochromocytoma without metastasis is 95%, while that sounds terrifying, I like to think of those as pretty good odds considering how many patients are noncompliant or have other issues. While it sucks, chemotherapy is usually much more effective than radiation, especially in the case of this particular cancer. Edited for grammar. As for discussion with patients. I have seen a patient with a cancer that we biopsied and we weren’t able to diagnose. The pathology report said it was something within the realm of an ovarian/endometrial cancer, but it wasn’t conclusive and had never been recorded before. There was a 2 hour discussion explaining how we would approach treatment with essentially no data to go off of and discussing how we would choose which treatment to approach and that we couldn’t promise or have confidence that it would work. She only came in at a late stage, and she sadly did not survive. But, because of the discussion she was able to choose to die in hospice surrounded by her family once it was clear treatment wasn’t working. While it is hard, it is sincerely important to have these conversations when we just don’t have data to back our recommendations. Thankfully, I would say this is not the case for your pheochromocytoma, while it is rare, we do have extensive medical studies performed on this cancer with n=3,000 or greater.",363,0,0,"['start', 'i', '’', 'sorry', 'that', 'really', 'disgusting', 'i', 'work', 'amazing', 'spine', 'surgeon', 'also', 'trained', 'oncology', 'his', 'approach', '’', 'explain', 'something', 'never', 'ignore', 'either', 'run', 'tests', 'imaging', 'provide', 'referral', 'specialty', 'might', 'insight', '1', 'with', 'symptoms', 'provided', 'referral', 'neurology', '’', 'find', 'anything', '2', 'we', 'never', 'say', 'anyone', 'symptoms', 'nothing', 'if', 'continue', 'followthrough', 'multiple', 'appointments', 'tests', 'exams', 'means', 'symptoms', 'bothering', 'significantly', 'each', 'specialty', 'narrow', 'perspective', 'entirety', 'medicine', 'refer', 'find', 'continue', 'followup', 'see', 'anything', 'progresses', 'usually', '’', 'take', 'long', '3', 'i', 'hate', 'say', '’', 'affect', 'us', 'send', 'advanced', 'imaging', 'it', 'takes', 'seconds', 'order', 'nothing', 'takes', '2', 'minutes', 'read', 'images', 'if', 'insurance', 'fights', 'sucks', 'wait', '6', 'weeks', 'send', 'saying', 'continue', 'pain', 'approved', 'denying', 'imaging', 'lazy', 'the', 'concern', 'imaging', 'sometimes', 'find', 'things', 'ambiguous', 'require', 'observation', 'testsi', '’', 'sorry', 'i', 'treated', 'one', 'patient', 'active', 'newly', 'diagnosed', 'pheochromocytoma', 'currently', 'regularly', 'see', 'second', 'patient', 'pheochromocytoma', 'remission', 'evaluate', 'progression', 'disease', 'at', 'point', 'time', 'i', 'say', 'alive', 'i', 'say', 'perspective', 'orthopedic', 'spine', 'surgery', 'said', '18', 'people', 'history', 'medical', 'studies', 'pheochromocytoma', 'metastasis', 'spine', 'i', 'small', 'study', 'base', 'go', 'discussing', 'treatment', 'patients', 'for', 'patients', 'general', 'best', 'recommendation', 'going', 'major', 'facility', 'like', 'sloan', 'kettering', 'physicians', 'actually', 'see', 'things', 'regularly', 'pheochromocytoma', 'rare', 'occur', '08', '100000', 'people', 'there', 'around', '333', 'million', 'people', 'us', 'major', 'facilities', 'regular', 'interactions', 'cancers', 'with', 'wanting', 'fight', 'concerns', 'experience', 'physician', 'particular', 'cancer', 'i', 'recommend', 'tertiary', 'facility', 'additionally', 'young', 'son', 'genetic', 'testing', 'also', 'performed', 'cancer', 'associated', 'rare', 'genetic', 'conditions', 'i', 'child', 'i', 'would', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'while', 'radiation', 'variable', 'pheochromocytoma', 'i', 'would', 'hope', 'chemotherapy', 'the', '5', 'year', 'survival', 'rate', 'pheochromocytoma', 'without', 'metastasis', '95', 'sounds', 'terrifying', 'i', 'like', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'odds', 'considering', 'many', 'patients', 'noncompliant', 'issues', 'while', 'sucks', 'chemotherapy', 'usually', 'much', 'effective', 'radiation', 'especially', 'case', 'particular', 'cancer', 'edited', 'grammar', 'as', 'discussion', 'patients', 'i', 'seen', 'patient', 'cancer', 'biopsied', '’', 'able', 'diagnose', 'the', 'pathology', 'report', 'said', 'something', 'within', 'realm', 'ovarianendometrial', 'cancer', '’', 'conclusive', 'never', 'recorded', 'there', '2', 'hour', 'discussion', 'explaining', 'would', 'approach', 'treatment', 'essentially', 'data', 'go', 'discussing', 'would', 'choose', 'treatment', 'approach', '’', 'promise', 'confidence', 'would', 'work', 'she', 'came', 'late', 'stage', 'sadly', 'survive', 'but', 'discussion', 'able', 'choose', 'die', 'hospice', 'surrounded', 'family', 'clear', 'treatment', '’', 'working', 'while', 'hard', 'sincerely', 'important', 'conversations', '’', 'data', 'back', 'recommendations', 'thankfully', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'case', 'pheochromocytoma', 'rare', 'extensive', 'medical', 'studies', 'performed', 'cancer', 'n3000', 'greater', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Chemotherapy', 'Radiation Therapy']",Unable to specify

I think that’s how I got e.coli and I was on the toilet for a week 😭I feel you on the bacon 🫡 just touching my tongue to it was enough to trigger painful heartburn during my chemo days and the smell it left in the house was usually too strong for me to be around. What was it like having a feeding tube if you don’t mind me asking?? I think I almost reached that point because I couldn’t eat or drink anything for almost two weeks due to constant gagging and nausea so I’m curious.I think it was McDonalds cheeseburgers that held me down for a bit when I couldn’t eat anything lolComplimentary pic of my chickies ✨Thanks I really appreciate it. I’m so tired right now but I can’t get myself to sleep. I’m just feeling all sorts of things both physically and emotionally right now that it’s freaking me out. I want to continue living, things were just starting to look good in life. What type of cancer do you have?Thank you ❤️ so many new puppies in the comments makes me want another pet but I already have two puppers as well haha i want more 🥹Thank you ❤️ I’m going to see if I can potentially re-home them in the event that I pass away and enjoy my time with them as much as I can. Hopefully I’ll be able to see them lay eggs at one pointThank you for sharing your story with me. ❤️ This gives me hope that maybe just maybe this cancer can be treated.I was using edibles to help with the appetite and nausea but if she can’t hold anything down or hasn’t been able to eat it’s time to go to er or contact the oncologist",340,0,0,"['start', 'i', '’', 'sorry', '’', 'going', 'someone', 'finally', 'diagnosed', '28', 'i', 'similar', 'experience', 'dealing', 'ongoing', 'symptoms', 'since', 'i', '26', 'one', 'doctor', 'straight', 'told', 'take', 'vitamin', 'd', 'i', 'told', 'i', 'kept', 'getting', 'sick', 'hr', 'bp', 'shot', 'nowhere', 'tried', 'blaming', 'weight', 'i', '’', 'even', 'super', 'overweight', 'i', 'active', 'i', 'even', 'blatantly', 'misdiagnosed', 'er', 'found', 'primary', 'tumor', 'it', '’', 'frustrating', 'females', 'pain', 'downplayed', '’', 'seen', 'exaggerating', 'add', 'young', 'need', 'deal', 'whole', '“', '’', 'young', '’', 'fine', 'deal', '”', 'doctor', 'mindset', 'it', '’', 'frustrating', 'i', 'get', 'angry', 'i', 'hear', 'people', 'getting', 'dismissed', 'i', '’', 'learned', 'navigate', 'healthcare', 'system', 'way', 'one', 'tolol', 'i', '’', 'definitely', 'eating', 'lot', 'healthier', 'sight', 'anything', 'greasy', 'sugary', 'make', 'want', 'gag', 'like', 'makes', 'cringe', 'almost', 'i', 'take', 'bite', 'anything', 'sweet', 'fatty', 'i', 'love', 'salty', 'foods', 'still', 'though', 'during', 'chemo', 'i', '’', 'eat', 'anything', 'warmhot', 'though', 'smells', 'would', 'trigger', 'nausea', 'i', 'still', 'get', 'bit', 'nowoof', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'made', 'smart', 'choice', 'avocado', 'sushi', 'i', '’', 'realize', 'i', 'neutropenic', 'already', 'thought', 'i', 'ok', 'little', 'bit', 'sushi', 'one', 'point', 'chemo…boiii', 'i', 'wronggg', 'i', 'think', '’', 'i', 'got', 'ecoli', 'i', 'toilet', 'week', '😭i', 'feel', 'bacon', '🫡', 'touching', 'tongue', 'enough', 'trigger', 'painful', 'heartburn', 'chemo', 'days', 'smell', 'left', 'house', 'usually', 'strong', 'around', 'what', 'like', 'feeding', 'tube', '’', 'mind', 'asking', 'i', 'think', 'i', 'almost', 'reached', 'point', 'i', '’', 'eat', 'drink', 'anything', 'almost', 'two', 'weeks', 'due', 'constant', 'gagging', 'nausea', 'i', '’', 'curiousi', 'think', 'mcdonalds', 'cheeseburgers', 'held', 'bit', 'i', '’', 'eat', 'anything', 'lolcomplimentary', 'pic', 'chickies', '✨thanks', 'i', 'really', 'appreciate', 'i', '’', 'tired', 'right', 'i', '’', 'get', 'sleep', 'i', '’', 'feeling', 'sorts', 'things', 'physically', 'emotionally', 'right', '’', 'freaking', 'i', 'want', 'continue', 'living', 'things', 'starting', 'look', 'good', 'life', 'what', 'type', 'cancer', 'havethank', '❤️', 'many', 'new', 'puppies', 'comments', 'makes', 'want', 'another', 'pet', 'i', 'already', 'two', 'puppers', 'well', 'haha', 'want', '🥹thank', '❤️', 'i', '’', 'going', 'see', 'i', 'potentially', 'rehome', 'event', 'i', 'pass', 'away', 'enjoy', 'time', 'much', 'i', 'hopefully', 'i', '’', 'able', 'see', 'lay', 'eggs', 'one', 'pointthank', 'sharing', 'story', '❤️', 'this', 'gives', 'hope', 'maybe', 'maybe', 'cancer', 'treatedi', 'using', 'edibles', 'help', 'appetite', 'nausea', '’', 'hold', 'anything', '’', 'able', 'eat', '’', 'time', 'go', 'er', 'contact', 'oncologist', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,['Chemotherapy'],Unable to specify

986,no-user-names-,"Hello. I’m UK also. I’m guessing you’ll have been down this route, but have you contacted the Macmillan helpline? 08088080000 They are amazing. If you have an oncologist you can’t communicate with / you feel blocked by etc you can get fantastic information from them and loads of options to ask for that you might not have been offered. Or travel to one of the Maggies Centres who are also amazing. https://www.maggies.org/ Obviously you want to stop the cancer, but have you been referred to palliative care for pain control? They’re amazing too - it doesn’t mean they have given up on treating you - but they may offer far more creative options than the oncologist. Big hugs. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.The concept of a chosen family is fantastic. Chosen family are those who throughout your life have wanted the very best for you. It could be the one teacher who really saw the child you were, or an aunt or neighbour, or perhaps a pet who loved you unconditionally. They are your chosen family, and the positive energy they gave to you freely still lives with you today. Some of us are lucky enough to have chosen family members in their lives today. Cancer is incredible at pointing out who these people are. Love them, cherish them, make sure they know how much you appreciate them. Cut your losses with people who take energy from you, or their giving is totally conditional. Cancer is hard enough, but dealing with the hurt of people who are “supposed” to care makes dealing with cancer so much worse. Reflect on your chosen family who have given to you freely, and try to focus on them. They are worthy of your love. Even if they are not with you any more, they will help you heal.

I don't think you got carried away; you just went on with your life and thought you could have this one thing to yourself. Perhaps there is a middle ground?

1011,pilarofsociety,"This is so wonderful. I’m really happy for you ❤️My mum (65) was diagnosed two months ago with stage 4 NSCLC (adenocarcinoma). It was a huge shock as she’s a non-smoker and has always been quite healthy. I’d strongly recommend a biopsy with genetic testing if that’s not already been requested. Some lung cancers occur due to a genetic mutation (like EGFR) and there’s targeted treatment available (Tagrisso for EGFR) that’s highly effective for most patients with such mutation. Stage 4 cancer is a lot to deal with, but I can say our family is in a much better place now than at the start, when there was so much uncertainty, fear, and not knowing how to navigate through it all. You will work it out together. Sending you strength.Really sorry to hear about your mum. I have a similar story. My mum went to see the doctor about back pain a couple of months ago and was diagnosed with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer that’s metastasised to the spine. The biopsy results will be very important because if she has certain gene mutations she can have targeted treatment (like Tagrisso for EGFR mutation) that can be effective for a while with few side effects. There are people who have taken Tagrisso for years on Reddit and other forums. So make sure they do genetic testing as part of the biopsy. I’d advise against reading the survival stats online. The data is mostly very old, before the availability of targeted treatment. The data also doesn’t separate by age, so you have 80/90 year olds who were near the end alongside much younger people. Sending you strength ❤️Wonderful news, thank you for sharing the positivity, and wishing you continued progress.Thank you, I really appreciate this. What was the trajectory like in the days after starting radio, e.g. did you feel worse before feeling better? She has bone destruction at c5 and L5. I just want her to feel a bit better so she can see there is hope.Thank you for your story, that gives me a lot of hope.She’s in NI and it’s public holidays until Tuesday frustratingly. She was told maybe she’ll see the oncologist a week later, but it’s very vague. I’m very frustrated by the whole process (NHS) but appreciate it can be a whole lot worse.Thank you, I’m glad you’re feeling better. They’re doing the gene mutation testing and I’m hopeful for EGFR as she’s an east Asian non-smoker. I just need to get that oncologist appt asap.Thanks for your reply. I’m in EGFR resisters and it’s very informative. This is for when we have the exact mutation information - but is there a resource on prognosis by mutation? For example, the prognosis for those with mutations that can be targeted must be better than for those without.Thank you for this. Did they say prognosis for Tagrisso is 5 years?UPDATE: My mum saw her oncologist today who said she has EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation, plus a rare ILE706THR mutation. She’s starting Tagrisso next week assuming her blood tests are normal. The doctor said Tagrisso works on average for 2 years but varies. In the circumstances, I think this is positive. I hope everyone else is doing ok.Thank you, same to you ❤️Thanks so much for this. What did the doctor say to you about the prognosis, if you don’t mind me asking? My mum is such a trooper too.

I hope you are at peace with whatever route you choose. I am tired. I am ready to go. But my boyfriend will be really sad. That’s the only person I’m holding on to.I have lung nodules since 2022, and they have grown but I’m always told it’s no big deal. This scares me because I’ve had cancer two times already, and now my oxygen level is low and nothing like before and I wish they would do more tests on these. I also have liver lessions, 2 were found in ER as accidental finding. I went to my cancer center because of my colon cancer, and they found that the lesions have grown and there’s actually four instead of 2. So they do a MRI which was inconclusive, and they’re too hypo dense whatever that means and not normal. So they have to monitor them. My question is why not just do a biopsy and get an answer for me then. I don’t like waiting and not knowing. I’m always in pain. Vomiting and so forth. We will see October on my repeat tests. I’m so sorry what you’re going through and I’ll pray that it all turns out fine and Jesus takes control. You are so sweet and amazing towards your mom. ❤️❤️",230,0,0,"['start', 'i', '’', 'sorry', 'i', '31', 'i', 'hysterectomy', 'i', 'endometrial', 'cancer', 'i', '’', 'kids', 'i', '’', 'unable', 'carry', 'obviously', 'it', 'robbed', 'happiness', 'i', '’', 'feel', 'women', 'enough', 'days', 'i', 'pray', 'youi', 'think', 'i', 'reason', 'live', 'frankly', 'i', '’', '34', 'i', 'lost', 'everything', 'i', '’', 'penny', 'name', 'i', '’', 'family', 'support', 'either', 'i', '’', 'many', 'pain', 'meds', 'i', '’', 'feel', 'much', 'anything', 'anymore', 'i', 'would', 'like', 'die', 'i', '’', 'christian', 'therefore', 'feels', 'i', 'basically', 'committing', 'suicide', 'it', '’', 'something', 'i', 'struggle', 'i', 'really', 'want', 'go', 'route', '’', 'belief', 'god', 'take', 'us', '’', 'time', 'i', '’', 'losing', 'faith', 'quite', 'frankly', 'i', '’', 'mad', 'god', 'like', 'why', 'i', 'hope', 'peace', 'whatever', 'route', 'choose', 'i', 'tired', 'i', 'ready', 'go', 'but', 'boyfriend', 'really', 'sad', 'that', '’', 'person', 'i', '’', 'holding', 'toi', 'lung', 'nodules', 'since', '2022', 'grown', 'i', '’', 'always', 'told', '’', 'big', 'deal', 'this', 'scares', 'i', '’', 'cancer', 'two', 'times', 'already', 'oxygen', 'level', 'low', 'nothing', 'like', 'i', 'wish', 'would', 'tests', 'i', 'also', 'liver', 'lessions', '2', 'found', 'er', 'accidental', 'finding', 'i', 'went', 'cancer', 'center', 'colon', 'cancer', 'found', 'lesions', 'grown', '’', 'actually', 'four', 'instead', '2', 'so', 'mri', 'inconclusive', '’', 'hypo', 'dense', 'whatever', 'means', 'normal', 'so', 'monitor', 'my', 'question', 'biopsy', 'get', 'answer', 'i', '’', 'like', 'waiting', 'knowing', 'i', '’', 'always', 'pain', 'vomiting', 'forth', 'we', 'see', 'october', 'repeat', 'tests', 'i', '’', 'sorry', '’', 'going', 'i', '’', 'pray', 'turns', 'fine', 'jesus', 'takes', 'control', 'you', 'sweet', 'amazing', 'towards', 'mom', '❤️❤️', 'end']",endometrial cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,เพศหญิง,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,"['pain', 'vomiting blood']",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,['Unable to specify'],carcinoma
1018,puffedovenpancake,I’m so sorry. When I was diagnosed it took a week to get biomarkers back. I had a liquid biopsy. Because I was also a never smoker and a middle aged female they said I probably had a biomarker. Once they know the biomarker they can begin the correct treatment. I think it was about 3 weeks between an mri showing a tumor and when treatment started. I too was having issues (breathing and pain) that were getting worse. I had a pleural effusion that showed up on the mri and had to have it drained which helped a lot. Once treatment started I slowly started feeling a lot better over the next few weeks. It’s so frustrating and scary to wait. I look back and a lot of that time is a blur. I’m sorry you are here. Best wishes to your mom and you and your family.Have you been to dana farber?

1036,rollerG12,"Thank you and best of luck!I don’t have any biomarkers. My cancer is KRAS mutated.Sorry you’re experiencing this…I just want to say, that side effects are not always cumulative and everybody is different. My first round of chemo was also the hardest, yet I just finished cycle 5 of 6 and this past cycle was the easiest so far. It was almost like my body had a tough time for the first round because the chemo was so foreign to my body, but it adjusted overtime. It might be tough all of the way through. Take it a day at a time. Dont worry about the 8+ more rounds, just get through today. Do that over and over again, and eventually you will be done. Anything worth doing is difficult.Well said. I struggled with the notion of “fighting” at first. I thought about the people who are so sick at the time of their diagnosis that they don’t even get the chance to “fight” and we would never say that they didn’t “fight” or “gave up” or whatever, so I keep thinking to myself how on earth can we call it a fight when it seems like luck/random for those who even get an opportunity to see treatment and have a chance to survive…I almost felt like calling it “fighting” was a slap in the face to those who don’t have a chance to “fight”… Then I came to my own conclusion that fighting is just continuing on with cancer. Whether it’s showing up to work every day, or laying in a hospital bed. Whether you feel great or you’re encumbered by intense pain. The second that you realize that you have cancer, your fight begins whether you know it or not, and no matter what you decide your plan of action/treatment (or lack there of) will be. Much love. Stay strong out there 💪.28 with stage 4 lung cancerSeriously. I got my last scan results back within 3 hours.I feel pretty good, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I was told that I’m early in treatment so we aren’t even necessarily expecting shrinkage because the immunotherapy may not have had enough time to begin working yet. So I am very happy to see a response already, I am hoping that this is a good sign for long term results. Second, through my lung cancer journey I have been reading about how new genetic mutations and targeted therapy are “changing the game” for lung cancer treatment and how it’s saving lives. However, I have found way less hopeful insight around treatment for patients that do not have these targetable mutations, and I do not have any of these mutations so I was worried that treatment would be less effective for me. I almost felt left out and like I had less hope. I am hoping that I will have some continued success with treatment and can provide hope for patients who don’t have targeted therapy and have to stick with the standard chemo/immunotherapy. Overall, we are not out of the woods yet, but for how early I am in treatment I think this is a very good response and we wouldn’t be expecting much more this early on based on what I discussed with my care team.",307,0,0,"['start', 'thank', 'best', 'lucki', '’', 'biomarkers', 'my', 'cancer', 'kras', 'mutatedsorry', '’', 'experiencing', 'this…i', 'want', 'say', 'side', 'effects', 'always', 'cumulative', 'everybody', 'different', 'my', 'first', 'round', 'chemo', 'also', 'hardest', 'yet', 'i', 'finished', 'cycle', '5', '6', 'past', 'cycle', 'easiest', 'far', 'it', 'almost', 'like', 'body', 'tough', 'time', 'first', 'round', 'chemo', 'foreign', 'body', 'adjusted', 'overtime', 'it', 'might', 'tough', 'way', 'take', 'day', 'time', 'dont', 'worry', '8', 'rounds', 'get', 'today', 'do', 'eventually', 'done', 'anything', 'worth', 'difficultwell', 'said', 'i', 'struggled', 'notion', '“', 'fighting', '”', 'first', 'i', 'thought', 'people', 'sick', 'time', 'diagnosis', '’', 'even', 'get', 'chance', '“', 'fight', '”', 'would', 'never', 'say', '’', '“', 'fight', '”', '“', 'gave', '”', 'whatever', 'i', 'keep', 'thinking', 'earth', 'call', 'fight', 'seems', 'like', 'luckrandom', 'even', 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'treatment', 'chance', 'survive…i', 'almost', 'felt', 'like', 'calling', '“', 'fighting', '”', 'slap', 'face', '’', 'chance', '“', 'fight', '”', '…', 'then', 'i', 'came', 'conclusion', 'fighting', 'continuing', 'cancer', 'whether', '’', 'showing', 'work', 'every', 'day', 'laying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'whether', 'feel', 'great', '’', 'encumbered', 'intense', 'pain', 'the', 'second', 'realize', 'cancer', 'fight', 'begins', 'whether', 'know', 'matter', 'decide', 'plan', 'actiontreatment', 'lack', 'much', 'love', 'stay', 'strong', '💪28', 'stage', '4', 'lung', 'cancerseriously', 'i', 'got', 'last', 'scan', 'results', 'back', 'within', '3', 'hoursi', 'feel', 'pretty', 'good', 'couple', 'reasons', 'firstly', 'i', 'told', 'i', '’', 'early', 'treatment', '’', 'even', 'necessarily', 'expecting', 'shrinkage', 'immunotherapy', 'may', 'enough', 'time', 'begin', 'working', 'yet', 'so', 'i', 'happy', 'see', 'response', 'already', 'i', 'hoping', 'good', 'sign', 'long', 'term', 'results', 'second', 'lung', 'cancer', 'journey', 'i', 'reading', 'new', 'genetic', 'mutations', 'targeted', 'therapy', '“', 'changing', 'game', '”', 'lung', 'cancer', 'treatment', '’', 'saving', 'lives', 'however', 'i', 'found', 'way', 'less', 'hopeful', 'insight', 'around', 'treatment', 'patients', 'targetable', 'mutations', 'i', 'mutations', 'i', 'worried', 'treatment', 'would', 'less', 'effective', 'i', 'almost', 'felt', 'left', 'like', 'i', 'less', 'hope', 'i', 'hoping', 'i', 'continued', 'success', 'treatment', 'provide', 'hope', 'patients', '’', 'targeted', 'therapy', 'stick', 'standard', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'overall', 'woods', 'yet', 'early', 'i', 'treatment', 'i', 'think', 'good', 'response', '’', 'expecting', 'much', 'early', 'based', 'i', 'discussed', 'care', 'team', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Targeted Therapy', 'Chemotherapy']",carcinoma

1055,sizzlingtofu,Probably not the best comparison because my friend hadn’t been to the doctor in YEARS and was relatively healthy. She had a stroke out of the blue which they confirmed was caused from cancer clotting her blood and she died three weeks later. She had not really been eating a few months though and kind of keeping to herself about it. I would say when she hits a point where she does not want to eat at all that’s a sign the end is near. It’s tough if you’re taking meds that might affect appetite. She also had no pain.

1057,sleddingdeer,"This is your decision and you’ve had enough experience to understand what your choice entails. You need to tell your doctor first and perhaps your oncologist can speak to your parents for you or with you to help them understand. It sounds like your parents aren’t going to give you their permission, but you have reached the age when you don’t need it. This is never going to be easy for them to accept so go at your own pace. They will come to terms with it. They have no choice. I’m sorry. Chemo is awful. Some regimes are absolutely unbearable. I’m really sorry you got this raw deal. I think you are very brave for listening to your inner voice. I wish you peace and a miracle.I find this comment cruel. This is OP’s life and they have every right to make decisions that are best for them. In OP’s case being strong means choosing quality of life over quantity because that’s what’s in their heart.Be direct. “Aunt, I know you mean well, but you must stop suggesting treatment options to me. I am comfortable with my medical team and you are inadvertently hurting me and stressing me out. I know that you love me and that is unintentional, but I need you to hear me when I tell you to stop.” She will feel bad and may get defensive, but do not engage any further. Just say, I have told you how I feel and that’s not going to change. If she persists, leave, end the conversation. Every single time.I’m sorry. Unfortunately, many people are disappointing in crises which is incredibly painful. First, ask for money again. See if you can get some. I say that because it’s an absolute necessity and if you can get some help, it’s worth enduring the awkwardness. I had a major medical event and agonizing recovery and also got basically no help from most of my family. It was traumatic and made me feel so unloved. It’s important to recognize and honor the depths of your wound rather than rush to forgive. I also question the need to forgive people who aren’t apologetic. If they don’t see that their behavior was wrong, the problem is ongoing. For me, I had to process my pain as trauma and it was really hard and took a long time. I had to understand how their actions touched on childhood pain so I could detangle and understand my feelings. Then I decided that it permanently changed how I felt about them. I am relieved of my obligations for the rest of my life. This isn’t to say I might willingly give and be of service, but I am completely free of a duty to anyone on this planet excluding my children. There is not a guilt string to pull in my heart. I relish this freedom. After I had processed my trauma and healed physically, I had some heart to hearts with some people (maybe you’d want to do that with your parents) where I explained how their lack of care cut deep. It felt good to say what I wanted to say and I didn’t feel the need to sugarcoat it, though I wasn’t ranting either. I came to an important understanding with one family member that carved a path to reconciliation. That wouldn’t have been possible if my pain was fresh and unprocessed. I still do not feel any sense of obligation. People define forgiveness differently, but to me it often sounds like a conditioned response to sweep things under the rug or else you’ll be an angry bitter person. I think that’s hogwash! I did deep work and have moved forward, rather than forgiving them. My internal work helped me accept and then let go of what happened which I think is important for my heart. My decision to move forward reflects my choice not to feel isolated and without family, which is an act of love for myself. I don’t want to live in exile.

1062,smartypants333,"February of 2021 my appendix burst. While they were scanning for that they said ""Huh, we see a little something here in your lung. It's probably nothing, but you should probably get it checked out when you get out of the hospital."" Got it checked out, it was stage 1 lung cancer. While they were doing the scans for that so they could remove the lower right lobe of my lung (April) they found a brain tumor. ""It's not cancer, but it still needs to come out."" So after I recovered from my lung surgery, I had brain surgery in June. They said that I was cancer free at that point, but it came back stage 4 (in my bones) 18 months later (Sept 2022).I was let go because I personally had cancer, and requested to continue to work from home for 3 additional months (in 2021 when Covid was still in full effect!) Companies aren't messing around with this RTO BS. And although I probably could have sued, I didn't want to waste my time. If I didn't sign away my right to sue they wouldn't give me my 2 months severance.I got ""the button"" for the 3 days I was in the hospital after my lobectomy. The nurse was also nice enough to set it up so the end would light up when I could have another dose. I was in a lot of pain, and it didn't get a whole lot better once I got home, but unlike some have said, my doctors did gave me opioid pain meds. My oncology team also refilled my prescription anytime I ask. I've been VERY careful not to ""dose up.""I was diagnosed stage 1 in 2021 (age 43), had surgery (to remove the lower right lobe of my lung) and was told I was cancer free. It recurred 18 months later (2022), stage 4, now in my bones and the pleural lining. I am going to say, that for me, I'm experiencing the absolute blessing that is modern medicine. I hesitate to say blessing because I'm not religious. My cancer has a genetic mutation that can be blocked with a targeted treatment. A single pill I take every day that has minimal side effects. I haven't had any chemo or radiation. I have CT scans every 3 months, and as of my last scans, I have no progression. The drug works on average 3-10 years until you become resistant.

I definitely had these sentiments I thought why on earth did I fight so hard just to go back to this grind, work pay bills, where are the epic bucket list moments. Instead of celebrating my body’s ability to heal I felt betrayed. I felt like a ghost in the in between. Therapy helped me gain perspective and resolve my anger around my missed diagnosis. Maybe your area offers free cancer support networks. I am sorry you feel this way. ❤️Pain in my rib back, tried physio, acupuncture, yoga nothing helped eventually got so bad I would yelp whenever I moved. Doc ordered CT was read negative for everything no osseous lesion detected. I thought impossible and working in physical rehab I got my images not just report. Found a black hole pathological fracture of 8 th rib in 156 of 1300 images. Knew instantly I was looking at a lytic lesion. With much difficulty and mention of involving CPSO I got bone scan. Confirmed malignant. Biopsy later. Langerhans cell sarcoma. Thoracotomy to remove 8th rib and chunk of chest wall. Currently NED.I completely appreciate your approach! I can’t imagine your experience, that’s the thing with cancer it is so individual. In our situation with stage iv pancreatic unfortunately we don’t have 13 years to gain perspective or a thicker skin. I thought I could maybe just provide some insight and impact some of the communication for our immediate situation. I know there are folks who embrace the fight language and made point to acknowledge that. I hope your daily balance continues to be more about life and less about cancer. Thanks for the insight ☮️I appreciate the you got this between you and your wife. It paints a nice image of support and encouragement in the moment. Positive not hopeful is a great observation. I think that is exactly what we are. When you know your are terminal and treatment is to extend life and maybe push things back gain some quality in that time the focus is different. We definitely focus on the positives keep our perspective a bit more narrow and in the now. I am sorry for the loss of your friend and I hope for the best outcome for you and your wife.That’s all you can do.

1120,wisteria_town,"Ports can dislodge afaik. But not easily. I was told by a nurse that one of the kids on my pedi ward was playing once and doing some tumbles or something. Her port was accessed & apparently it dislodged because of her movements. I wouldn't really risk it tbh. It probably wouldn't be comfortable either. I know I get uncomfortable on things like bumpy car rides with my port in place, even when it's not being accessed. Couldn't tell you about how painful port placement is since I was knocked out for mine. Moved around like a robot for 3 days. But afterwards the pain subsided and I had no more issues with it. Port access doesn't hurt either, I never needed any numbing cream or stuff. It's honestly less painful than getting a regular blood draw. Just a pinch at best, sometimes I'd wait for the nurse to access my port (put the needle in) like ""Did it go in?"" because I wouldn't even feel it.Being direct and telling her you do not need any treatment suggestions is one way, but I found that it doesn't help. Honestly. People think they know best and you cannot shake that. You can argue with them until you're blue in the face & they'll still come out of it thinking ""Well I know best and I want what's best for (OP) why don't they accept my help!!"". I've had this encounter a hundred times over, literally just today too. I've stopped arguing & just retreat nowadays. A personal experience would be when a lady whose daughter has soft tissue cancer iirc was talking my ear off about going vegan, cutting sugar out, ""natural remedies"" all of that bullshit. She literally told me ""Well get on eating!!"" with a snarky tone (when she heard my CBC was low) & when I explained I've a bunch of restrictions that don't allow me to eat a variety of food (neutropenic diet & precautions that have been working wonders for me, not a single infection so far) she said I ""trust my doctors too much"". Thanks boo, I'll keep trusting them, I don't feel like dying yet. I know she's your aunt & you don't want to hurt her feelings but don't let her hurt yours. I'm sure she wants what's best for you but boundaries have to be established. This well I know the secret remedy! stuff is dangerous behavior IMO because while you might not fall for it, others will. See the lady above. Best of luck & health OP 🤍🤍🤍OP I'm 17 & also have blood cancer (acute myeloblastic leukemia). So sorry you had to join this shitty club.
