0,-Suriel-,"Congratulations and good on you for persisting till they found a cause. Way to advocate for your child!!11 rounds of FOLFOX and 4 of 5fu here. I hate the hassle of toting that damn 5fu pump around. I’m 15 rounds deep with it and I don’t feel the needle anymore though. You get used to it and it becomes normal. Like others have said, not all the effects are cumulative. Mostly just the neuropathy in my experience. All the other symptoms you start to adjust to. The nausea is what got me, and the diarrhea. After every round I would go back to my oncologist and let her know what meds weren’t working. I went through quite a few before I landed on a good combo. Keep pushing till you find things that works for you. As for showering, I gave up on treatment weeks. I bought disposable wash clothes - they are just giant baby wipes - and use those. You can buy big packs at dollar tree. The nurses are used to it, I promise. I’ve had convos with mine about it. I’m sure this all feels daunting and awful but you can do it. You’re stronger than you know. Good luck to you Edited to remove paragraph about take down.I filled out those story of my life journals, wrote birthday cards, cards for big events, made videos of me reading kids books, made photo albums, and made videos of me telling my daughters birth story along with videos of me telling her about her grandparents. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’m 39 with an 8 year old. I’m stage four and have been told I probably only have another year or two left. So I unfortunately can relate.I also have NETs. It sounds like you have a pancreatic primary with maybe a met to the liver from your comments. Do you know your ki67? I am stage 4, was diagnosed last December and I too struggle with facing death. I am currently seeing a therapist who deals exclusively with medical patients. We have been doing emdr and that has helped a bit.I’m currently 39. Diagnosed at 38 with Stage 4 neuroendocrine cancer.

4,1LungWonder,"18 years post-treatment... every day I have some issue related to surgery or treatment.. teeth are horrible, extensive nerve damage due to radiation, not to mention breathing issues due to losing a lung. My doctor actually said to me ""Be happy you're alive! Most people don't make it."" It's not that I'm not happy, I would like a better quality of life. I have good days, great days, and not so good days. I take things one day at a time. I'm very happy to still be alive, yes.. but I guess I'm chronically ill and in pain.. it is what it is I guess.Does your psychologist understand post-cancer trauma and PTSD? Survivorship is a shit show.. I want you to know it's totally understandable and normal. Everyone around us expects us to be happy and positive and living every moment to its fullest, when in actuality getting up in the morning is a struggle. Finding people who understand can help, finding a support group or therapist who gets it is vital. I'm going on 19 years... I promise it does get better.. is it back to what it was pre-cancer? No, but it can be a good life despite all you've been through. Please be kind to yourself and give yourself grace... please feel free to reach out if you ever need a sympathetic ear. I'm happy to listen.I celebrate the day I had my surgery to have my lung removed. We call it ""Lungleavin' Day"" the day my lung left... We celebrate by writing our fears on a plate and smashing the plate in a bonfire. We started sharing the occasion with friends and family and it grew to become a really incredible celebration. We used it for a fundraiser for mesothelioma, the cancer I lost my lung to.. Up until the pandemic... 2020 was our last party.. My husband, son and I still smashed plates every year though.. We are going to start back up in 2025 again.. it feels like a good time to celebrate. February 2nd.. for most people its Groundhog's Day.. for us?

6,1kSuns,"I wish this was less common. My daughter, now 27, was diagnosed with stage 4 mbc in November of 2021. 4 years prior she started bringing up that she had a lump in her breast to her primary care physician, who dismissed her by telling her she was too young for it to be anything serious. The next two visits where she came in to ask questions about the same lump were outright dismissed to the point where she didn't bring it up to anybody else because she felt she was making too big of a deal out of nothing. The next 4 years were filled with multiple incidences of symptoms that should have raised a red flag but every time she was written off because she was young. (And let's face it, female, which seems to be a pre-existing condition to being ignored by doctors) It's valid to be angry and frustrated, and I wish there was an actual solution to get people listened to by their medical providers.My mother died when I was about the same age as your son. The one thing I really wish I had was recordings of her. At that age, it's highly unlikely for him to retain direct memories of you, so his entire knowledge of who his mom was, is going to come through the lens of someone else's memory of you. At least for me, that has always left me feeling very disconnected from her, because I don't know who she was as a person.

33,AdventurousSleep5461,"It's perfectly normal to cry and be upset about this; it's scary! My hospital has a special counseling department for cancer patients, you might consider asking your doctor for a referral to at least talk to someone about your feelings in a therapy setting.""Thanks, but I'm going to listen to my oncologists on this. They went to medical school to learn about treating cancer and have been practicing and actually treating cancer patients for x years."" And if they continue after that I'd stop answering their calls/texts/messages. I don't have the bandwidth to be polite anymore, so ignoring inappropriate behavior is all I can manage that won't cause more issues.Honestly I would talk to an employment attorney and see what they advise. In another comment you mentioned there was a deadline that you weren't told about, so I would get documentation of that and any emails regarding your requesting WFH to care for a close family member and take that with you. Just forward the emails, and any future ones, to your personal email account. Also if you have any proof of them accommodating another employee so they can buy a house and move bring that as well.After I finished breast cancer treatment I felt the same way, I think it's pretty normal. I mean our bodies decided to try to end us, how can we not be suspicious that they won't do it again? I will say that the further I got from treatment, and the more years NED I had, the more confident I became that I might actually reach old age. Don't stress it, this is normal.I was really open about it the first time... And a lot of people in my life disappeared. It sucked, but I guess the trash took itself out? I dunno. People get really weird when you tell them you have cancer, so be aware that you may lose some friends in this process. Up front everyone was all super supportive, but then it became crickets as things went on. I don't say that to deter anyone from sharing their diagnosis, but to let you know that if people go missing it's absolutely not you. It's 100% them.

She was diagnosed 5 days after initial paralysis after A&E sent her home to be literally carries/dragged by her son and daughter. I understand the heartache and anger all too well. She had asked her Dr, A&E and Out of hours for an X-ray in January because she was in excruciating pain and all three of them turned her away. Three months later she was paralysed from the waist down and non even three months after that she passed. Treatment wise there was nothing they could do, radiotherapy didn’t work and as she was immobile chemo wasn’t an option. She was in palliative care at home but had to spend almost two weeks in hospital after catching covid, e-coli in her urine etc. The Saturday before she passed she was taken into hospital by ambulance, the Dr wanted to keep her in but she wanted to go home so we took her home. She passed a week later at home surrounded by her loved ones. If your mum wants home take her home! If the hospital can’t help then there’s no need for her to be there. This disease is absolutely horrific and declines happen suddenly and quickly. Cherish every moment. We were told to expect between 4-6 months and she only lived four weeks. A few hours before she passed we were told another few days and she passed within hours.

38,Alienspacedolphin,"A few years back one of my bestest buddies had not just one but TWO metastatic cancers. (Renal cell and mantel cell lymphoma) He never did like to do anything halfway. They said he wouldn’t make it a year so threw himself a memorial service. Bought a shiny red convertible on credit. Decided to do chemo and did better than anyone thought he would. Threw a ‘second memorial service’. Wrote his own obituary and insisted that his ashes be sprinkled on the lawn of his worst enemy so he could haunt him forever. He drove the hell out of that car. Smoked on oxygen and survived. Took me dancing. He taught me more about painting and composition while criticizing art at MD Anderson than I’ve learned anywhere else. (Ive had to do some time myself at MD Anderson as of late, their care is better than the art) I miss you my friend. You knew how to live.I had a total hysterectomy last November for endometrial cancer, and yeah, it’s normal. I was lucky and didn’t need anything else. I was basically physically completely recovered in 3 months, even placed in a 5k. Be kind to yourself. Even though the surgery and recovery are relatively easy from a physical standpoint, it’s a lot to take in, and took me longer to readjust mentally/emotionally. Best of luck to you, and I hope all goes well.Yes- it can be hard talking to others. You don’t have to. It’s tough telling people and dealing with their emotions.

42,Amarie_Vanya541,"I am sorry to hear that you are facing this, and I am sorry that you are facing it alone. In the past 10 years I've faced cancer 3 times, recurrent ovarian carcinoma - now in this third time with cancer I've had chemo twice, last year and this year. We are all different so what works for each of us may be different too, but I hope sharing what I have done so far may help you. ACCEPT: We can't change it. This is what God [or life, or the universe - whatever your belief system is] has thrown on our plate, so the only thing we CAN do is deal with it. It helps if your belief system, as mine is, includes believing that we are never given something that we cannot bear or cannot deal with. So whatever it is we are faced with, we are actually able to bear. GET INFO: Discuss options with your doctor, and search for info online as well, check that info with verifiable and authentic sources. Get second and third opinions either formally or informally (doctor friends, if you have them, other patients who have gone through the same / similar situation). GET SUPPORT: Friends, family, faith groups... the closer, the better and the more physical the better. What I mean is there may be times when you are going to need someone with you, so find this. If you can't have many physically to support you, then, you can explore what I did which is to supplement with paid options such as private nurses, maid or similiar. While getting support, remember not to ask from people more than they can give. Everyone has their own limitations and you can't force people to be there for you. They are either there or they are not. AVOID UNSUPPORTIVE PEOPLE: People who scare you with horror stories, pessimistic people and people who try to sell you stuff and people who think YOU should entertain THEM. STRATEGIZE: put a strategy in place that would help you cope better. Are you working? If yes, can you sustain in your present job or do you need to search for better options to earn income? I'm sure you've already realized that illness comes with hidden costs. Do you have children that you need to care for and be responsible for? Can you cope with that or do you need (3) SUPPORT in order to do so? Do you have EPF / Insurance etc? Are you eligible to tap on these nest eggs if you need to? I applied for full EPF withdrawal 2 years before I was supposed to be eligible and it was approved. I used that money sparingly but it has helped me set things up so that my entire treatment process is now easier. CONTINGENCIES: Whatever you decide as your strategy, have multiple layers of backup plans. I have 3 main sources of income, and a 4th I can tap on in case the other 3 is insufficient. My support system also includes backups in case my main support is unavailable. HANG IN THERE: This is the most challenging thing and in order to be able to hang in there at all times, (3) SUPPORT is important. You need a go-to for those times when you're crumbling or when you feel like giving up or at the end of your rope. I have weekly online groups that help me, as well as my husband and other family members who buck me up when I am down and shower me with love at all times from near or far. My husband reminds me that I am a patient so I have to be patient. My family and friends send me their prayers and well wishes. Build such a group for yourself if you haven't already. Other options would be a professional counsellor / psychologist who specializes in this area. Ask your doctor if there are support groups and keep in contact with other cancer patients so that you can help each other stay strong. HAVE FAITH. Believe that whatever is ordained for you that is the best thing. Believe that there is an opportunity for beauty and joy in any kind of existence, even in illness. Whatever you are going through, God / life / the cosmos has opened multitudes of doors (opportunities) for us to transcend our reality and attain true enlightenment, so that nothing can touch our well-being. I hope some of these help.",386,0,0,"['start', 'i', 'sorry', 'hear', 'facing', 'i', 'sorry', 'facing', 'alone', 'in', 'past', '10', 'years', 'ive', 'faced', 'cancer', '3', 'times', 'recurrent', 'ovarian', 'carcinoma', 'third', 'time', 'cancer', 'ive', 'chemo', 'twice', 'last', 'year', 'year', 'we', 'different', 'works', 'us', 'may', 'different', 'i', 'hope', 'sharing', 'i', 'done', 'far', 'may', 'help', 'accept', 'we', 'cant', 'change', 'this', 'god', 'life', 'universe', 'whatever', 'belief', 'system', 'thrown', 'plate', 'thing', 'can', 'deal', 'it', 'helps', 'belief', 'system', 'mine', 'includes', 'believing', 'never', 'given', 'something', 'bear', 'deal', 'so', 'whatever', 'faced', 'actually', 'able', 'bear', 'get', 'info', 'discuss', 'options', 'doctor', 'search', 'info', 'online', 'well', 'check', 'info', 'verifiable', 'authentic', 'sources', 'get', 'second', 'third', 'opinions', 'either', 'formally', 'informally', 'doctor', 'friends', 'patients', 'gone', 'similar', 'situation', 'get', 'support', 'friends', 'family', 'faith', 'groups', 'closer', 'better', 'physical', 'better', 'what', 'i', 'mean', 'may', 'times', 'going', 'need', 'someone', 'find', 'if', 'cant', 'many', 'physically', 'support', 'explore', 'i', 'supplement', 'paid', 'options', 'private', 'nurses', 'maid', 'similiar', 'while', 'getting', 'support', 'remember', 'ask', 'people', 'give', 'everyone', 'limitations', 'cant', 'force', 'people', 'they', 'either', 'avoid', 'unsupportive', 'people', 'people', 'scare', 'horror', 'stories', 'pessimistic', 'people', 'people', 'try', 'sell', 'stuff', 'people', 'think', 'you', 'entertain', 'them', 'strategize', 'put', 'strategy', 'place', 'would', 'help', 'cope', 'better', 'are', 'working', 'if', 'yes', 'sustain', 'present', 'job', 'need', 'search', 'better', 'options', 'earn', 'income', 'im', 'sure', 'youve', 'already', 'realized', 'illness', 'comes', 'hidden', 'costs', 'do', 'children', 'need', 'care', 'responsible', 'can', 'cope', 'need', '3', 'support', 'order', 'do', 'epf', 'insurance', 'etc', 'are', 'eligible', 'tap', 'nest', 'eggs', 'need', 'i', 'applied', 'full', 'epf', 'withdrawal', '2', 'years', 'i', 'supposed', 'eligible', 'approved', 'i', 'used', 'money', 'sparingly', 'helped', 'set', 'things', 'entire', 'treatment', 'process', 'easier', 'contingencies', 'whatever', 'decide', 'strategy', 'multiple', 'layers', 'backup', 'plans', 'i', '3', 'main', 'sources', 'income', '4th', 'i', 'tap', 'case', '3', 'insufficient', 'my', 'support', 'system', 'also', 'includes', 'backups', 'case', 'main', 'support', 'unavailable', 'hang', 'in', 'there', 'this', 'challenging', 'thing', 'order', 'able', 'hang', 'times', '3', 'support', 'important', 'you', 'need', 'goto', 'times', 'youre', 'crumbling', 'feel', 'like', 'giving', 'end', 'rope', 'i', 'weekly', 'online', 'groups', 'help', 'well', 'husband', 'family', 'members', 'buck', 'i', 'shower', 'love', 'times', 'near', 'far', 'my', 'husband', 'reminds', 'i', 'patient', 'i', 'patient', 'my', 'family', 'friends', 'send', 'prayers', 'well', 'wishes', 'build', 'group', 'havent', 'already', 'other', 'options', 'would', 'professional', 'counsellor', 'psychologist', 'specializes', 'area', 'ask', 'doctor', 'support', 'groups', 'keep', 'contact', 'cancer', 'patients', 'help', 'stay', 'strong', 'have', 'faith', 'believe', 'whatever', 'ordained', 'best', 'thing', 'believe', 'opportunity', 'beauty', 'joy', 'kind', 'existence', 'even', 'illness', 'whatever', 'going', 'god', 'life', 'cosmos', 'opened', 'multitudes', 'doors', 'opportunities', 'us', 'transcend', 'reality', 'attain', 'true', 'enlightenment', 'nothing', 'touch', 'wellbeing', 'i', 'hope', 'help', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['No symptoms identified'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,['Chemotherapy'],Unable to specify

Also eating more often can offset nausea if that is an issue. Hunger can increase nausea. Ice cream. Popsicles. I would say just get calories.My husband has stage 4 adenocarcinoma diagnosed in February 2024. We both are physical therapists. He did 4 rounds of chemo and immunotherapy with no luck. He started HER2 Thursday of this last week. You guys could be twins. Hoping like you that this new treatment kicks his cancers ass. I really appreciate your contribution this sub.Came here to say this.Husband same diagnosis. Diagnosed in February. Wait for bio markers. They will guide treatment. Lots of progress in this field. Stay positive.

53,Anon-567890,"💔💔😭😭What country are you in? Can you switch to a different cancer center?You guys can always get a second opinion as there is lots to considerGosh, I’m so sorry to hear this. I know how awful you all must feel! This is such a shock. It is so difficult being patient through the complete diagnostic process. They will test his biopsy for mutation markers and PD-L1 which will guide the oncology team in forming a treatment plan, whether targeted therapy if he has certain markers to immunotherapy with adequate PD-L1. There could be chemo or radiation in the mix. Those alternative options are not something I’d focus on. Stem cell therapy is only in clinical trials. You should have access to excellent oncologists in the Seattle area. Listen to them as they form a treatment plan. I wish you all the best. Keep us updated! (I’m 9 years out from a Stage IV adenocarcinoma diagnosis with 6 recurrences, just FYI.)Great answer and may I just add that staying hydrated is of utmost importance? I drink tons of water in the first few days to flush out toxins. I’m lucky I love water and drink it exclusively, and always have “my emotional support water bottle” right by my side always! 🤣What country are you in? You should have regular appointments with your oncologist. When does chemo begin?I lived clean. Never smoked, ate right, worked out regularly. When I got diagnosed with stage IV adeno my oncologist said it’s becoming more common in female non-smokers and they don’t know why. I quit asking because it doesn’t serve me to ask. By the way, that was 9 years ago. Focus on treatment and maintaining health! Sorry you’re here in this sub and your mom is lucky to have you! We are here for youThis good news makes us all happy! 🤍🤍🤍You get in a “chemo rhythm.” First one it’s hard to know what to expect. And everyone’s side effects will be different, so keeping a chemo journal will allow her to know that, maybe, by day 5 she can walk more, or by day 10 she gets her appetite back (whatever her side effects are). That way she can kind of know what to expect each round. I was always able to work the day after (probably because all those steroids), but by Saturday evening the “darkness” descended. But always know there is light after the darkness. Always! Hope she tolerates everything with as few side effects as possible! 🤍🤍You are a warrior! Thank you for advancing the science!!I’d get a second, maybe third opinions from oncologists.Thank you for your kind words! I’m grateful that your mother is doing so well after her brain surgery! I’ve never dealt with that yet. I’m glad the timing of posting my story helped you! Please share my story of hope with your mom!! Hugs! 🤍🤍Thank YOU for all you do for all of us here! 🤍Thanks to the anonymous Kind Redditor for the award! 🥰🤍🥰🤍I felt lymph nodes on the left side of my neck. No other symptoms. Already stage IV at diagnosis. So surgery wasn’t on the table.I hope you get good results from the chemo. No fun, and it’s difficult to focus on the good when all seems bad, but I’ve been lucky to be in the light after the darkness! I wish you the best! We are here for you! 🤍🤍🤍Thank you for these kind words! Been on the struggle bus this week because I haven’t had chemo in so long and I kinda forgot what a challenge it is!

54,AnxiousDiva143,"I am a little older at 38 and also have stage 2 breast cancer. Just want to say I’m sorry you are dealing with this. There is another group called breastcancer that may be helpful to you as it has been very helpful to me. There are one people around your age on there as well.I have breast cancer right now for the first time and recurrence is my biggest fear. When I first got diagnosed they told me it was early, was about 0.9 cm and didn’t show any lymph node involvement from biopsy/mri. Found out I had a genetic mutation with no history of cancer on either side of my family. Okay dmx. Surgery path showed a macromet of 7 mm. Okay radiation. My ki67 was high early on so it was aggressive. Oncoscore was 24 so now I’m doing chemo. I am receiving 4 dose dense AC treatments and 12 weekly taxol. I received my second dose of chemo today. The first round was rough not going to lie. Nausea was awful but before my second dose and even when I was at home I was communicating back and forth with the oncology nurse. I was able to mychart my questions or even call if I wanted and she would message back quickly or call back for further information. I got good premeds: steroids and two nausea meds: aloxi and emend. I had others on hand at home compazine and zofran for daytime bd olanzapaine at night. I was switched to phenergan to try and I also got some Reglan when I went to the ER for some shortness of breath ( it turned out to be nothing and may have been anxiety related). Some people say nausea is similar to heart burn so I also do Pepcid daily now or you can do protonix. I did get headaches from all the nausea meds I took. I did however not throw up once. I am now trying a sancuso patch this round to see if it helps. There are many options to manage your side effects. The best thing you can do is find an amazing medical oncologist and I promise you they will do everything they can to manage every single symptom you have. It is scary. My doctor told me I might have some anticipatory nausea this round so she gave me Ativan at the infusion. They will literally do everything to make you as comfortable as possible. You just have to tell them your symptoms and stay on top of them. Best of luck.I’m so so sorry for you and your family. I can’t imagine everything your poor little boy has had to endure. The fact that you’re even asking if everything is going to be okay still just shows how positive of a person you are. I think you’re the only one that can really answer that question for yourself. I know it’s hard but please stay strong for your boy. You are such a wonderful caring loving mother and your son is so lucky to have you in his life. 🤗",294,0,0,"['start', 'i', 'little', 'older', '38', 'also', 'stage', '2', 'breast', 'cancer', 'just', 'want', 'say', 'i', '’', 'sorry', 'dealing', 'there', 'another', 'group', 'called', 'breastcancer', 'may', 'helpful', 'helpful', 'there', 'one', 'people', 'around', 'age', 'welli', 'breast', 'cancer', 'right', 'first', 'time', 'recurrence', 'biggest', 'fear', 'when', 'i', 'first', 'got', 'diagnosed', 'told', 'early', '09', 'cm', '’', 'show', 'lymph', 'node', 'involvement', 'biopsymri', 'found', 'i', 'genetic', 'mutation', 'history', 'cancer', 'either', 'side', 'family', 'okay', 'dmx', 'surgery', 'path', 'showed', 'macromet', '7', 'mm', 'okay', 'radiation', 'my', 'ki67', 'high', 'early', 'aggressive', 'oncoscore', '24', 'i', '’', 'chemo', 'i', 'receiving', '4', 'dose', 'dense', 'ac', 'treatments', '12', 'weekly', 'taxol', 'i', 'received', 'second', 'dose', 'chemo', 'today', 'the', 'first', 'round', 'rough', 'going', 'lie', 'nausea', 'awful', 'second', 'dose', 'even', 'i', 'home', 'i', 'communicating', 'back', 'forth', 'oncology', 'nurse', 'i', 'able', 'mychart', 'questions', 'even', 'call', 'i', 'wanted', 'would', 'message', 'back', 'quickly', 'call', 'back', 'information', 'i', 'got', 'good', 'premeds', 'steroids', 'two', 'nausea', 'meds', 'aloxi', 'emend', 'i', 'others', 'hand', 'home', 'compazine', 'zofran', 'daytime', 'bd', 'olanzapaine', 'night', 'i', 'switched', 'phenergan', 'try', 'i', 'also', 'got', 'reglan', 'i', 'went', 'er', 'shortness', 'breath', 'turned', 'nothing', 'may', 'anxiety', 'related', 'some', 'people', 'say', 'nausea', 'similar', 'heart', 'burn', 'i', 'also', 'pepcid', 'daily', 'protonix', 'i', 'get', 'headaches', 'nausea', 'meds', 'i', 'took', 'i', 'however', 'throw', 'i', 'trying', 'sancuso', 'patch', 'round', 'see', 'helps', 'there', 'many', 'options', 'manage', 'side', 'effects', 'the', 'best', 'thing', 'find', 'amazing', 'medical', 'oncologist', 'i', 'promise', 'everything', 'manage', 'every', 'single', 'symptom', 'it', 'scary', 'my', 'doctor', 'told', 'i', 'might', 'anticipatory', 'nausea', 'round', 'gave', 'ativan', 'infusion', 'they', 'literally', 'everything', 'make', 'comfortable', 'possible', 'you', 'tell', 'symptoms', 'stay', 'top', 'best', 'lucki', '’', 'sorry', 'family', 'i', '’', 'imagine', 'everything', 'poor', 'little', 'boy', 'endure', 'the', 'fact', '’', 'even', 'asking', 'everything', 'going', 'okay', 'still', 'shows', 'positive', 'person', 'i', 'think', '’', 'one', 'really', 'answer', 'question', 'i', 'know', '’', 'hard', 'please', 'stay', 'strong', 'boy', 'you', 'wonderful', 'caring', 'loving', 'mother', 'son', 'lucky', 'life', '🤗', 'end']",breast cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,เพศหญิง,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['No symptoms identified'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Chemotherapy', 'Radiation Therapy']",carcinoma

59,Arsenicandtea,"I don't have cancer, honestly not sure why this was a notification, but as a mom I wanted to respond to you. As parents there's this deep pain at the thought of our children dying. They've been spending years fighting to keep that pain away. It's honestly selfish because they're causing you pain so they don't have to have pain. Here's my suggestion, say to them ""Mom, dad, I know you love me. I know you've been fighting hard to have the long life I should have had. I know you want to see me grow and live a long life, I want that too, but that's not the life I am going to have. I can't know how long my life will be but I can decide on the quality of the life I have. What I have to do to keep living doesn't make a life worth living. I am going to stop the chemo and count my life by the quality not the quantity. I want to spend however much time I have left building happy memories with the people I love. There's nothing you can do about me dying, but I hope your last memories of me are happy ones knowing I've had a good life and lived it on my terms. I hope you choose not to spend whatever time I have left fighting me and angry at my decision. I love you both so much.""

66,Average_Random_Bitch,"Same here. I had my first round of this (which was pretty serious with several major surgeries, 9-months chemo, desperately ill) and had zero help from family. Saw my mom making this elaborate meal for a friend who had broken a leg or something and, without thinking, said, oh, that's so nice. I wish I'd had someone do something like that for me when I was going thru chemo or even one of the surgeries. I mean, I said it without thinking and meant it as a compliment and she took it as a criticism, which upon reflection maybe she should have. She retaliated with instant over the top fury, screaming at me, spittle coming out of her mouth, etc. And now I'm going thru a reoccurrence and having chemo again and adopting my two very young grandkids and, no lie, struggling a bit altho I certainly haven't complained to them about it. They and my siblings are aware that I am fighting cancer as well as a super corrupt DCFS system, alone, which I merely informed them of, as opposed to telling them for purposes of getting any assistance. Because I've already learned that even if I were living 15 mins from them, I'd get zero support of any kind, especially emotional which is what I need maybe even more than financial RN because this is one of the hardest things I've ever done (in every aspect). I haven't received the first text, email, or phone call asking how we are (I am) doing, or of any offer to help, or how are the kids. In fact, most of the update photos and videos I send receive zero response. Zero, at all. No encouraging words for getting the kids the help they need or joy in their progress and milestone successes, or anything. It's stunningly mindboggling. But I've done this before so it's also sadly unsurprising.

68,Aware-Marketing9946,"In 2015, I was blacking out. Then it happened while I was driving. By God's grace I didn't hit anything. 5 doctors. One guy, supposedly ""a top doc"" told me I had one particular condition...which I had already considered myself, but I knew I didn't fit the profile for. But ignore me he did. And I kept blacking out. Finally my physiatrist said ""I think you have severe stenosis"" (which I SUGGESTED TO ALL 5 DOCTORS, BUT WHAT DO I KNOW 🙄) MRI showed my spinal cord ""folded"" in 5 places. 3 discs missing. And other things. In total, my neck was ""broken"" in several places. How I managed to work, keep a huge garden and property, watch my grandkids....I have no idea. I ended up having an almost 8 hour surgery. Had a halo attached for 5 months. My neck is all metal and allograph. So much for being told: I had POTS I was ""post menopausal"" (gotta love that one) I was just ""anxious"" 🙄 I needed ""therapy"" It was ""hormones"". I was dehydrated. It was in my head. After 9 surgeries, 6 major, and decades of dealing with these medical people I just don't have patience anymore.Oh dear. Every time I read something like this makes me glad I volunteered to be a patient advocate. (I am also a patient myself). This has happened to me so many times I keep boxing gloves in my purse. So I can come out swinging when you (doctor) tell me some kind of shit like what happened to you. I've no more time for being dismissed and ignored. The damn doctor works for us....boy they seem to forget that don't they? Do everything you can to learn about your health situation. Ignore doctor's who tell you NOT to ""look things up on the Internet"". Dammit any healthcare person says that to ME, they better duck. I'm not kidding. I got insulted, scorned, made fun of, matter of fact I've had docs break all their own rules and guidelines. Two male radiologists literally tag teamed me... my husband was mortified...you gotta be really dumb to do that especially in front of him. All because I insisted on knowing my risks. As it turns out, radiation was AT BEST only a 2% benefit to me. All this damage to my body, for what? I now tell everyone I see the truth. How to navigate this ""system"". This shitty, compromised, rotten so called medical care we have. We pay 20% of our income on healthcare. We in the US are ranked 24th. That's all you need to know. I will absolutely advocate for myself and others. A smart doctor sees this on my face, and does his job. In the end that is all I ask... Do your job. Help me. Be a partner with me in my betterment.AWESOME!!!!!,🤗💞🤗Get estradiol cream. It will heal your insides and atm it's considered safe as it doesn't travel past the blood barrier. You need debt consolidation. Is there anyone you know with any banking or fiduciary experience? I've handled a few for family. I was misled as well. I was angry. But we can't stay that way. Take one day at a time. Deep breath. I will pray for you🙏🫂I'm 63. Cry if you need to. Please hang in there. It's going to be ok. I had a total hysterectomy in 2018 (cancer #3) and that was the easiest surgery out of the 9 I've had so far. I'll be praying for you 🙏I know it's kinda late but here are some things that help after that surgery: Heating pad. My back hurts so bad after. And it wrapped around my sides too. I love the auto shutoff on mine. Body pillow and or small squishy pillows Assortment of teas. Calming teas. Super helpful. Small ice packs. Have your essentials next to the bed. Get a bed tray...or see if someone can pick it up for you. Baby wipes Something to do while reclining...I love gel pens and adult coloring books or drawing paper. I'll be thinking of you. I am sorry you live alone. Do you have a trusted neighbor? You could call your local social services and request rides, or help. I volunteered for an org called fish. We bought food, picked up meds .. whatever the person needs. Reach out to your care team and ask about any after care. I had a visiting nurse for 6 weeks, once a week. She was a lifesaver. After my dmx I could barely look at my scars/chest. She did so much for me. Please look into it. Insurance covered it. I'm a DM away if I can help, lmk. Btw, not that you asked...but everything still, um, works ""down there"" if you know what I mean. I'm with you in spirit, and I will absolutely pray for you🙏🤗👊🫂 prayers sent 🙏 My surgery is in a few weeksCan you reach out to anyone to secure help for the future? I went to a Vocational Agricultural high School. It's not far from me. Maybe you can see if they can help? When I was in high school we did help people (volunteer) with their livestock. It would be a joy for you to keep them if you could. I wish I could help. I'm a farm girl.We say that in the hopes that everything will be ok. What should you do now? I can only surmise what I would do in your case. Your son is old enough to decide what he wants. As a mother I would look for treatment, and to love and support my son. Platitudes aren't helpful. I will pray on your behalf, for your boy, and offer an ear if you ever need it.Hmm. I'd have probably flipped the table. You're a better woman than me. 😉I found a few things that help: Sipping on ginger ale, and ginger chews. Green tea and chamomile helped a bit. She needs to stay hydrated... that will help. Small meals/bites of food. This will pass! Prayers to you and yours 🙏""I want to jam it with you""...😎Chopin: I love his Nocturnes, Ballades and Preludes. Mendelssohn: ""On Wings of Song"" (my favorite piece) ""Songs Without Words"" Anything Ce Ce Wynans. I love gospel as well. Aretha... don't need to say more! ""Rock Steady"" .. awesome tune! Tom Browne: ""Funkin' for Jamaica"". He's a trumpet player, and I saw him back in the stone age in NYC. Little Feat!!! Love this band! The album ""Let it Roll"". It's a total party.

73,Bama-1970,"I had RATS (Robot Assisted Thoracic Surgery) last December for a 1.2 cm Type 1A pulmonary nodule, which consisted of acinar and lepidic type adenocarcinoma. I had three small incisions below my rib cage on my left side, one for the camera and two for the instruments. They went through my rib cage to perform the surgery, breaking a rib. I spent 2 days in the hospital. I was discharged with OxyContin, but I didn’t have to take it. I took Tylenol for pain. The surgery itself wasn’t bad. My primary complications were atrial flutter and urinary retention from the OxyContin they gave me in the hospital. All the complications were resolved within five weeks after surgery. The surgery isn’t anything to be afraid of. It’s the best chance you have for a cure. The surgery makes you short of breath, so you have to use an Inspirometer for breathing for a while and walk to build up your lung capacity after surgery. They got all my cancer and found no evidence of cancer in my lymph nodes. I have to have CT scans every six months for five years to check for evidence of recurrence. I currently have no evidence of disease with a good chance the cancer won’t recur.Look in to RATS lung cancer surgery. I spent two days in the hospital. No oxygen after surgery.

I went to my doctor over and over... it went on for months. I was prescribed cough medicine, stomach acid meds, nasal spray, and a chest x-ray. My doctor's office said my lungs were clean so I trusted them. I then received a referral to an ENT doc who prescribed vocal therapy and that was the final straw. I called my oncologist who immediately sent me in for a CT and then a PET scan. They found nodules in my lungs and lesions on my bones. Apparently an xray is not detailed enough. After a pelvic bone biopsy they discovered that my breast cancer had metastasized to my bones and most likely my lungs. There are nodules that are too small to be biopsied but they are fairly confident it's also cancer.

78,Beautiful_Limit7801,"I’m so sorry you’re experiencing this, and I’m here to say I know exactly how you feel. Back in April I went in for surgery (oesophagectomy) and I was petrified - mostly because my brain was in panic mode and convincing itself we might not make it out alive. I spent the day before my surgery with my partner, his older brother, my soon-to-be SIL, their baby girl and his younger brother. We had what should’ve been a lovely day out shopping and grabbing lunch. I didn’t eat anything because I was so riddled with anxiety I would’ve been sick on the spot. We took the kids to the arcade and at that point, I don’t know what came over me but I walked away from the group, had a full blown panic attack and cried in my partner’s arms. I felt so guilty and as if I should just get a grip, but he insisted it was fine that I wanted to go back to my car. When we sat back in there, I cried my eyes out again. I kept having episodes like this for the rest of the day. I voiced how terrified I was that this meant I wouldn’t see him again and that we wouldn’t get the life together that I wanted. He did his best to comfort me but he admitted he was scared too. Leaving his house to drive home and pack that night was one of the hardest goodbyes of my life. Now? I’m 4 months post op and pretty much fully functional 90% of the time. The surgery wasn’t without complications unfortunately (but half expected from a major op which took 10 hours to do) and it kept me in hospital for over 3 weeks - but even so, I was up and about the day I came home from the hospital, driving within about 5 weeks and I’m already starting to feel like it didn’t even happen. I’ve since moved in with my partner (and the goodbyes are now a “drive safe, see you when you get home”) and I’m even now back to work. My point is: you’re completely valid to feel how you feel. You’re not unhinged, you’re allowed to be scared and/or upset. Give yourself grace, you’re experiencing major upheaval- it IS a big deal. BUT: you will be okay. Trust the experts to do what they need to do, I’m sure you will be in safe hands. And the fact that you’re eligible for surgery is usually a good sign. Good luck to you, look after yourself and you’ll be on the other side of the surgery soon enough ❤️There’s a book I saw someone give their mom recently, called “mom, I want to hear your story” - it contains pages with loads of different prompts for you to write your responses to and include stories about your life etc. It’s almost like a journal of your life and it’s something your son will always be able to keep hold of. I’m sure you could find it online - I’d definitely recommend it! It’s a lovely idea. Love and best wishes to you and your little one ❤️Good luck!

83,BetterNowThks,"i'm sorry you experienced this reality is this is most of our stories. I suggest filing grievances with all of the related organizations. Like everybody. Writing a letter to the provider doesn't do anything. If they are reported to their governing organizations, that sometimes, sometimes makes a difference. The bottom line is that these doctors are trained to ignore women's pain and discomfort. We are all considered crazy or attention seeking. another way to go would be a lawsuit, but it's such a slog. Definitely file grievances. Wherever you can find something that says ""to file a grievance"" - then do that.You will be ok! I'm 59, hysterectomy in April but the cancer had already burst a fallopian tube and that ovary and spread in the cavity so they took my peritoneum as well. I am on chemo every 4 weeks but in between I am able to do most everything. If you don't have spread, thank your lucky stars! The surgery is a big one but get up as soon as possible and start moving, i promise it helps! You can do this. 💕Rare cancer party. yay. Mine ovarian/fallopian cancer is from my freakin' dna. How do you escape that? I don't think you do, but my mom had ovarian cancer in the 70's and lived cancer-free to her late 80's so in my dreams this thing hits you once and leaves you alone for 3 or 4 decades. Probably not realistic but since almost no one has this RAD51 mutation, mu hopes and dreams seem as valid as what paltry science there is on the topic.Im sorry, and i want you to know that Stage 4 can still mean many years of a good quality of life! The treatments are getting better and better, so try and focus on the plan ahead, and of course you can plan some things for if/when you come to the ens of life. Just think though, people often live longer with Stage 4 than even their doctors thought they could. Live your life. Be a mom, love your spouse, do life between chemo sessions, make those memories...be yourself and live life well. Do rely on friends and family to have your back in the tough moments...Keep talking to us, we are listening! 💕One thing cancer doesn't do? It doesn't heal your narcissistic parents. Disengage from them, and embrace those people who demonstrate their love for you.This is normal for any of us who are or have undergone cancer treatment. I'm in treatment and will have chemo 6 of 6 in 2 weeks, them PARP for 3 years. I agreed to have a little celebration when chemo 6 is over but I have a kind of cancer that is almost guaranteed to return. I will never be the same.I'm doing a morning gratitude journal, and it helps, but the idea that a killer isn't coming for me is unrealistic and I can't live in fantasyland to make my family and friends feel better. I tell them I am doing well, and I smile but...the whole ""be happy"" and ""you fought cancer and won,"" thing...Jeez. Have some empathy! Yes have been ravaged by a killer and he's literally sitting in the shadow over here next to me, and he's waiting to attack again, and I am anticipating it, it's on my mind all the time. All the time. All that to say you are not alone.Nope. If they haven't had any shit go down in their life yet, it's coming. Everyone has something. Its cancer for you now, but try to assume that your friends don't think that they are perfect and that you are somehow not just because this is happening to you. If they're really your friends, they are going to rally around you. Allow yourself to be vulnerable. Be honest about your fears and feelings.

97,BreakfastInfinite116,"My dad does carbo/opdivo & yervoy every 3 weeks. The first treatments are the hardest, in my opinion, because you just don't know what to expect. Once she's gone through a round or two, you'll feel a bit more prepared. Before and after infusions, make sure she drinks a ton of water, clear fluids and electrolytes! If she's cold, sipping warm broth or soup is great. This helps flush out the residual meds and dead cancer cells after treatment, and can help prevent constipation. In our experience, the symptoms tend to be worse if my dad doesn't drink enough hydrating fluids. Try to avoid coffee or caffeine until after the infusions, especially if she doesn't have a port. We learned the hard way that it can make it more difficult to find veins. 😬 The first day or two likely won't be too bad because they'll give anti-nausea meds and steroids. For my dad's treatments, we have what we call the ""Dreaded Day 4"" which is usually when those wear off and he hits a brick wall of aches and fatigue. He now plans his treatments so that by day 3 or 4, he'll have a couple of days off to just rest and nap. Whenever she is feeling well enough try to take her on some walks, even if its only 10 minutes, and do some sort of light weight lifting or stretching. The last thing you really think about is making sure they workout, but it can actually help recovery and maintaining muscle is important during treatment.My understanding is that everyone has circulating cancer cells that the immune system regularly attacks. Cancer develops when, at some point, some of those cells mutate and/or the immune system can no longer kill them. Removing the tumor can be part of the solution and for many people it's enough, but there is a greater chance of a secondary cancer forming somewhere down the road. The thought behind immunotherapy is to ramp up your immune system to be able to kill those cells, but I've seen it go both ways. For some, the side effects are incredibly harsh and for others, not so much. You could also research some natural diet and lifestyle changes to support your body and immune system if you choose not to do keytruda.

That's how most rectal cancers only get diagnosed when they're at stage IV already. I find it unacceptable that women get shipped off with a prescription for Preparation H and dietary or lifestyle advice, when we know that's not what's going on. When I finally got a colonoscopy, I was lucky to only have a large benign tumour in my rectum. Which was then removed and confirmed non cancerous. And I will need to have another colonoscopy in two years. Cancer sucks in all its forms. Some are more prevalent and should be caught earlier to give us a fighting chance. Sorry for ranting as this sort of story hits close to home and really gets me angry with our healthcare systems worldwide. Wishing everyone here a good day 😊You must have lost your way. Otherwise, you'd know not to ask such questions here.So glad you got such good news . Congratulations 🎊This is really hard to hear and to process. We're here to let you know that you're definitely not alone. There is a path forward, a tough path but a doable path. Take your time to feel the feels. Because there's nothing better to do right now. Keep breathing, and drink lots of water. You will find your calm again in a while. Sending you big hugs 🫂 and light ✨️🪷Congratulations 🎊 Really happy for you 😊Hi, I gather from your post and comments that you have TNBC. There's another sub r/breastcancer where we hang out. Come join us, we're a very supportive and smart crowd. Either way, others here have given the best advice. I really loved calling it Schrodinger's results and treating it as excellent until proven otherwise.

114,Caseyleehs,"I had low iron, a serverly swollen stomach for about a month or so, pain (like period pain), I couldn’t get rid of it even with the hot water bottle and pills. I ended up burning my stomach with the hot water bottle right before I found out. I thought it was endo because it was all down in that area. Oh and from the swollen belly, I couldn’t eat or drink anything much either. I ended up taking myself to the ER cause I knew at the very least I’d be dehydrated. They suspected ovarian cancer but once I had surgery to take out my extremely big ovaries (both sides were so big they couldn’t even tell which was left and which was right on ultrasound) they found out it started in my colon and spread to ovaries. So lost both ovaries and about 12cm of my colon. It was a bit of a shock but I didn’t have many symptoms tbh. I didn’t think it was cancer at all, I really thought I had a reproductive issue like endo or PCOS.31. Diagnosed with colon cancer stage 4 this May.31 and was diagnosed this year. I’m already married so no dating help here. But my job made me redundant so that’s fun. I haven’t been able to go back to work yet. I have an upcoming surgery so who’s going to bother hiring me now 🙄 I find it did actually slightly help my depression. But aside from that, I didn’t really change much.

126,Chatmal,"If you want to celebrate any of your dates, go for it! Celebrate life and second chances! If you don’t, that’s okay too. I posted similarly earlier this year approaching my first anniversary finishing chemo. It didn’t feel like a celebration but I felt I should mark the occasion, commemorate the day. I felt like I was supposed to do something so I asked in this group. I was a little surprised that a bunch of people don’t throw big parties or even small dinners. Sounded like too many of us have people in our lives that don’t like to be reminded that we had cancer. Or maybe that cancer exists? Who knows? Some mark the day with a little thing. Someone had a tattoo. Maybe I could plant a tree. I ended up with some expensive gluten free bakery items that I took pix of and ate. I never posted the pix though. It was kind of underwhelming commemoration, but tasty. I kind of had flashbacks to finishing chemo, ringing the bell, but then still being so exhausted for weeks longer. I looked more than ever like a cancer patient while waiting for my hair to grow in and praying for energy. I don’t even know the date of my next onc visit where my labs were good, NED. I could look that up because that might be a better date to remember. I think better for me was having a trip to plan for. A few months later, my cousin was getting married across the country and I definitely wanted to go. I got to dress up, figure out how to pack that, and see family I hadn’t seen in ages. I also brought a bunch of heirlooms to my aunt and she loved looking through photos and other goodies I brought her. My brother came with me and after three days of wedding fun, we spent another week doing tourist things around the state. That was probably more healing for me than anything!I’d say this is a pointless argument. It’s not a competition to see who’s worse off. He can’t fathom your experience and it doesn’t sound like he even tries to empathize. If he wants an argument, don’t bother. Lose any passion for this discussion with him and just react Meh. Or Nah. Be or act so spiritually advanced that he cannot comprehend. I probably would have credited science with my survival and not god. Lots of studies and sciencing had to happen to ensure more patients survived.Kudos for asking and wanting to help your friend through this! -Cards of love and encouragement are nice. Celebrate the end of chemo or other milestones. -Depending on her home support, easy to eat snacks or meals. Stuff that requires minimal preparation. I like things like yogurt, cheese sticks and cut veggies. -Brain fog can get bad. Encourage other caregivers to take over certain tasks for a while like bill paying or sort the medical records and bills that come in. I brought an extra brain & driver with me to all of my dr appts for a while. Some I recorded on my phone so I didn’t forget what the dr said. Rides? Or maybe you can pick up her Rxes for her. Fairly quickly, the immune system drops, so help keep her away from unnecessary public places. If you’re seeing her frequently, do your best to wear a mask in public, get your flu shot and Covid booster (new one at the end of this month) to help protect her. Comfy pjs or loungewear might be good. I was soooo tired so I spent a lot of time in my pjs and I love cute pjs! (I had abdominal surgery so I needed very loose or soft waistbands, my oldest pj pants were the best!) -If you can spend time with her, just being nearby to chat with or not, if she’s tired. You can help her shop for chemo hats if she’s going to lose her hair. I found really cute lace slouchy hats that I really like and made me feel feminine on Amazon. If she likes tea, interesting flavors might be appreciated. I’ve got cherry berry, blackberry and some others I really like. I don’t even heat water (for now)! I’m doing cold infusion in my fridge to keep up hydration. -One of my friends texted me every few days to check on me and I so appreciated it! She works in health, so I told her about everything!

The amount of blood would vary but 9 times of 10 there was at least some.I went from stage 1 to stage 3 in a matter of a silent minute.

137,CoffeeB4Talkie,"You're not alone. I think what you're feeling is very common. I hope you find something that helps you find peace with what you've been through. I survived cancer twice. Two different cancers. I finished treatment for the first one in 2015, and finished treatment the second time in 2020. I also try hard to be normal and pretend that everything is okay....knowing the truth is I haven't been okay in a very long while. I'm still suffering the consequences of treatment, even right now. So I totally get it.Honestly, I had cancer twice. I finished my last treatment the week of Christmas/New Year of 2020. I'm still messed up about it. I feel that people who know my story just say ""well you're alive!"". And I am. I'm grateful for that. But being a survivor does not come without consequence(s).... and I have a lot of them. Then there's the constant doctors appointments and scans. Then I feel like I have my family that use my story as THEIR story for pity.. so I feel like I can't even be vocal about my bad days and feel what and how I truly feel.. because certain people make it about them. I've always said that watching your love one suffer can't be easy, so I get it. But I bury my feelings because I can't take other people's reactions to my issues. It stresses me out even more. It's a vicious cycle. Then my co workers with the smart comments whenever I have a doctors appointment.. like ""again?! when are you going to be done?"" Um.. as soon as I die.. because these ailments/side effects don't go away. But thank you for asking, I guess.IDK if it's accurate.... but I think of it as PTSD. I'm always worried/overwhelmed about it. I survived twice (two different cancers) and I'm always scared as shit that I will have to go through that shit again. Sometimes I get so frustrated with people around me telling me that I'm good because I survived... yeah I did. But clearly I don't have a good track record health wise. And I survived, but look at the side effects I have to deal with. It's A LOT. I appreciate the positivity, but sometimes it pisses me right off.Amazing! 🙌Congrats on 21 years of remission. You are not alone in your feelings.2x survivor here (different cancers). Side effects didn't get better, I just got used to it and try my best to accommodate my issues accordingly.Yes. I also had Cisplatin. I have hearing loss and now my kidney's are a little wonky (spilling protein in my urine). I haven't seen a doctor about the hearing loss. I guess I'm just tired of doctors and diagnosis at this point. How would you describe your hearing loss? For me, it's certain pitches that I just can't hear at all (high pitches). For example my husband was talking to someone nodded to their car and said 'belt issue?' When we were alone I asked how he knew that... and he looked at me all confused and said ""Ummm the car was squeaking....???"" I was shocked because I couldn't hear it. When people are talking to me sometimes it's like I'm in a pool underwater and the people talking to me are above water. I have to pay very close attention. Normally I try to read lips, but that's pretty hard when people are wearing masks. lol And then add the tinnitus on top of that.... Low pitches are hard to hear, but if I focus really hard I can hear (which annoys me when people talk to me from across the room, another room or with their backs turned to me because I can't hear you! Duh!).. or again, I try to read lips. My husband jokes and says it's selective hearing, but it's not.

145,Constantlearner01,"Well said. I am going to try that “travel if you feel good” since we had to cancel 3 trips with my diagnosis last December. I wonder if my fear of flying has gone away. Will test it out.Well said. I am trying to return to a normal pre-cancer life but struggling with side effects of the chemo maintenance med. I was trying to enjoy a festival yesterday and I was feeling a bit nauseous and GI system out of whack so I can never feel real joy lately. I went to this same festival a year ago before diagnosis and it brought me so much joy. The pictures people took yesterday just remind me of how I was struggling to keep up with them.Sometimes I feel like the realization of the mortality sits on the headboard, waiting patiently and when I wake up, jumps from the headboard to my shoulders and then I say “oh yeah, that’s right, I have this cancer with extremely high rates of recurrence” and realize once again time is limited and this is my world now. When I was first diagnosed, people with high survival cancer rates would say “You Got This” and “I Got Through This and So Will You.” But then you realize not all cancer is the same and some cancers haven’t had much research progress in 40 years!This thread is exactly why I tell people I relate more to reddit as a support group than any other outlet. Who knows more about the situation than people in my exact predicament? I finished my chemo last month and found out that is exactly when the depression hits. Most of us were in shock at diagnosis, then made plans for chemo and surgery and by the time that chemo ends, it catches up to us. You have time to breathe and wonder what the hell just happened? I reached out to the cancer clinic psychologist and had a couple appointments so far. I told her that the appointment should’ve been recommended the minute I was diagnosed. I am also disappointed about all the cancer groups that seem to accept donations but have a hard time finding the people they collect for. I didn’t know about many of these groups until after it was all done. One of them reached out to me when I told her my story about diagnosis and she said they have patients talk to med students but it has to be upbeat and positive and there is to be no calling out any medical provider who mishandled or misdiagnosed your cancer. The PARP med seems to be causing depression for me, like a heavy pall. I feel like I’m on the verge of taking a nap every minute of the day. I have two years of this to look forward to.

147,CorporateNonperson,"Thanks. I really appreciate it. Sorry that you are dealing with similar puppy stuff, and of course the Stage 4!Thanks! We (spouse and I) are both lawyers, as well, although she is in business instead of practice. I did one divorce around 2008. Never again. I don't see how family lawyers do it.I feel you. Sorry for the diagnosis! My mom is 71, not in great shape and aside from me the only close relative she has is my great aunt who is in her late 80s. Last go round I had a conversation with my wife about helping her out and what that would look like. Thia time depending on the prognosis, I'll probably set up a trust to benefit her, then to assist my siblings from my dad's second marriage. There's a bit of a plot twist because the spot was apparently on last year's scan, same size, but wasn't on the report. Probably not a huge problem, because NETs are slow growers and my last one was Stage 3 but Grade 1. No reason to think otherwise for this one in terms of grade.Well, I'm trying to stay positive. That said, my Chromogranin A, a neuroendocrine marker, is 414. Normal is 90 and last year I was at 70. That combined with spot is pretty no bueno.I'll admit that it wasn't a good look for her. She's realized it herself. She's planning on going to the MRI and oncology appointment with me. She's checking in with me about how I'm feeling it. She came over last night and we watched a movie and had dinner. Counseling sessions are ongoing. There were parts of the relationship where I wasn't pulling my weight. She's not great at communicating her needs, and so that builds resentment such that when she does communicate them it's not constructive. I told her this week that I needed to focus on this right now, so any effort to focus on us would have to start with her. I'll be there with her, but I only have so much capacity to freak out about something. And I really appreciate the effort that she is putting in. At the same time, I don't want to misread anything here. I don't know how much of this is her being my friend and how much of it is her wanting to give it another go, but right now I'll take anything I can get.So I'm on therapy right now. I wasn't in therapy during or after treatment. I would recommend it. The entire body/betrayal aspect is pretty loaded.

They originally wanted to perform a radical nephrectomy because it looked like the tumor was right up against the renal artery, however, a radiologist friend of mine reviewed my scans and told me he felt there was enough clearance for a sufficiently skilled surgeon to get between the tumor and renal artery. Ultimately, the surgeon (32 years of experience) decided he was willing to try, but told me he was going in old school. No robot or laparoscopic. Pathology was in the OR and confirmed that he was able to get it all without removing the bottom half of the kidney, but he did take the adrenal. Two years later, I was back in the OR for the opposite adrenal due to metastases. This past December, my pulmonologist finally got his interventional guy to go deeper into my windpipe to biopsy some lung nodules.

After 2nd trip to GI he ordered an ultrasound and found a 3.5 cm mass which they said was at the head of my pancreas. After a CT, and MRI and an endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy, I have a neurowndocrine turn or between my liver and pancreas, just got the PET scan last week, have an appointment this week with a surgical oncologist, hoping for operable 👍Sending hugs to you, I’m sorry you are going through thisHappy for you!That is so much to have going on at once, I’m sorry.

187,DownWriteCancerous,"Ask your hospital's social worker about options/support groups. There is also the option for nursing-assisted rehab. Basically staying in a hospital hotel while you recover. Its absolutely okay to want an adult or parental figure in these moments. Cancer is terrifying, surgery is scary and painful. Glad to see your kids are going to coming to visit. Community is so important with things like this. Church, friends, support groups, even sewing/hobby groups. For packing, if you're staying in the hospital: pillow (neck pillow or memory foam, soft throw blanket, tooth brush, soft super stretchy sports bra if you wear bras, big loose tshirt or dress, soft socks with grips (the grip is important, the nurses wont let you wear them usually without grip), a little battery or usb fan if you need a fan to sleep, and a comfort item or two. Maybe it's a picture frame of loved ones, or a stuffed animal (I have a weighted dragon that I've taken to every hospital stay). You got this. :)I got ""lucky"" with a very treatable cancer (Hodgkins Lymphoma). 3 years after I go into remission my mother is diagnosed with 2 separate breast cancers and then a neuroendocrine bone cancer. She has so may bone mets that the doctors have no idea how she is alive. I'm sick of people asking her about hospice. She wants to fight. She so desparately wants to hope and fight and keep living. The mets have reached her brain and now she's hospitalized with more pain that any human should have to endure. And she's had such awful care that she's gaslit herself. What is a 10 to someone who has experienced Hell for 2 years? I had to argue with the doctors and with her that no, she was not at an 8. Mom if your pain is so intense it is causing seizures, its a 10. It sucks and its hard and there is so little support.Stage 3 Hodgkin's Lymphoma survivor here! The ABVD is wild. Just melts the cancer away. Make sure to finish out your treatment and keep up with your yearly PET scan. While treatable, it has a fairly high reoccurance rate (my remission follow-up is ten years). And you're at risk of secondary cancers due to the chemo itself. So happy for you!

192,Dry-Ant-9485,"People are shitty when you lose a parent, when I lost my dad every one was all around offering support for the first few weeks, then nothing and I understand what you mean people want to avoid difficult situations. It’s normal how you are feeling you have been through intensely traumatic experiences I would recommend some specialist ptsd therapy and some CBT after. Medication for a short while should also help things balance out, but 4 months is early days and your feelings are normal your brain has to figure it all out and then your body which will be in a state of fight or flight should settle down. But don’t panic about school, take your time to process however I do think it may be an excellent way to honour your mother and yourself I used education as my coping mechanism by working supper hard (my father couldnt read or write) so it was very important for him we had an education, I used my love and respect for them to make them proud and these also have built my confidence. But at 19 there is no huge rush, first thing is get some support from your doctors it will help you understand your emotions and deal with the medical trauma you witnessed. There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him and try my best to honour him, people say times a healer it’s not for me, what helped me was professionals and medication as I also didn’t have a support network, do you have any other family members who you can lean on ? But I promise you that you have entered a very special group of people who after loosing a parent never ever take anything for granted you cherish the moments and you will become more resilient and loving than you ever imagined, you clearly are already an amazing human by stopping school to care for your mum is top level decent human status.

193,Due-Emu4273,"My (33F) mom (63F) was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma with malignant pleural effusion on June 17. Her original treatment plan was going to be chemo, however, they first found out through various testing that she had a PD-L1 % of 50%, which responds well to immunotherapy (elevates your immune system to fight the cancer). Then at a follow up appointment we found out that my mom has a targetable mutation (EGFR) which made her a candidate for targeted therapy with a once daily oral medication, Tagrisso. There are different targetable mutations so, if it hasn’t already been done for your dad, I’d say the genetic testing is worth the cost. I believe it’s called Tempus testing, if you’d like to research. There are so many unknowns when starting out, but it does get better! Make sure your dad keeps eating and keeps weight on as that may become more difficult. There are books about cancer diets if that’s something you’re interested in. Support groups can help both your dad and yourself as well. Sending you and your family positivity and strength.Congratulations on the results!

199,EStVM,"My original diagnosis in '88 was rhabdo, which would have given me a <1% survival at six months based on its location in my gut. Turns out that diagnosis was wrong; NIH determined I had a rare form of non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. I still had a rough time with it, and it was a ""bad year"" at the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown. I made it out, most others didn't. I have not met another childhood survivor who's my age, which is lonely. Skip ahead and I'm now 40 years old in an intensive outpatient therapy program just beginning to really process my survivor's guilt. It's common. It's okay to feel it. But it's really important you find some help processing it. I've done a tremendous job masking it, but I've been a mess in one way or another for the past 34 years.

I’ll hit 5 years in February so I guess that means I’m cured, but since they throw all the heavy treatments at it in adults and hope something works, I’m still nervous of it returning. I don’t feel cured.The tumor was in my right back muscles alongside my spine… “about the size of a package of Jimmy Dean sausage” according to my surgeons.They had to remove a good portion of spine to get clear margins, along with a ton of muscle tissues. Then I had to have tons of rods and bolts installed to support my spine. I’m mostly Cobalt from T-10 to my pelvis (screws are titanium). Safe to say my life has changed due to being differently able now. I get too tired still, which makes my right leg start skipping and nearly dragging due to nerve damage. All this said and I still struggle with survivor’s guilt. Why did the woman with my same diagnosis in her ankle not survive? She was younger, had a toddler and one on the way… so much life and new life left to enjoy. Why am I in the small statistic of adult survivors of this?

209,Egoy,"Sudden intense pain in my lower back right side that radiated down to my testicles. Hurt so much I threw up. I presumed a kidney stone (never had one) I went to urgent care and they gave me an X-ray and saw a very tiny stone. They gave me a prescription for a med that makes passing stones easier, and a strainer and told me to come back in a week if I hadn’t passed the stone. I didn’t pass a stone and went back, they gave me a CT scan and that’s when they knew. The ER doctor told me I don’t have a kidney stone and made a phone call to the urologist right in front of me and told him he was sending a file to him and he needed to look at it asap. That’s when I knew. Several cats and an mri later I was scheduled to have the kidney removed. No biopsy prior because the kidney was done for anyway. The real surprise was when the pathology on the kidney came back for Ewing’s instead of renal cell carcinoma.That sucks OP. It’s perfectly natural to fear chemo and radiation but if your fear is based on what you knew about them a decade ago things are better now than they were. I suggest a very honest discussion with your care team about your fears. Give them a chance to explain everything to you based on what patients are experiencing with your treatment plan today. It’s not pleasant (done them both myself) but there is a lot of things available to you that can help protect your health tissue and keep you safer and more comfortable during treatment.

211,ElectricalMedium2230,July 2023 went to acute care bc of pneumonia. Never had it in my life. Something told me to get an x ray so out of 20 acute care places in my town I went to the only one in town w onsite x ray. She said you do have pneumonia but you also have this little thing in your other lung I’m ordering ct. pneumonia cleared in about 4 days I felt great!! Low dose ct in August confirmed suspicious- pulmonologist said 99% cancer and you will have to get you ready for a surgeon - another ct in August. Sept 1st bronchoscopy lung adenocarcinoma confirmed considered stage one. Pet scan Sept no other spots still considered stage one. Pulmonary FT test was great. Scheduled for right upper lobe removal Oct 27. Oh look there missed a lymph node on all these scans- confirmed stage 3. Chemo started in Dec. Keytruda started in Feb. no signs of disease progression. Will stay on maintenance Keytruda until Feb 2025. Always listen to that voice in your gut- I personally think that voice is God. Had I not listened no telling where I’d be now.I’m stage 3B NED NSCLC diagnosed last year.

212,Electrical_Paint5568,"Well said. ""You've got this"" sounds trivializing, and doesn't leave room for the patient to feel all the range of emotions that come with being sick. I would also add, don't say, ""let me know if there is anything I can do"" because that doesn't work. Either you don't actually mean it or you're putting the onus on the sick person of the mental load to figure out what they need that they feel comfortable asking you for. When we get the diagnosis, we are too exhausted, and too much in shock to be able to make those kinds of decisions. Instead, if you really do want to help, offer options: I can help you with A, B, or C, which would you prefer? ""I would like to send you a care package, would you prefer food delivery gift card, or someone to clean your home, or snacks, or just cash?"" ""If you need help getting to your appointments, I can drive if you if I'm available or pay for your Uber. Would you like that?"" And when you contact the sick person, don't just ask how they're feeling. Share something normal. A meme. A cute cat video. A joke. A funny picture of your dog.

213,Electronic-Ad-4000,"The day I was cancer freeYea everyone has a different experience even if it is the same cancer/treatmentEvery time I try to agree to disagree he still wants to argue, damned if I do damned if I don't. I'd rather die than go through that again.. I don't have the strength anymore Relatable! But you are alive. You have to reset your expectations of yourself. Find your new norm. Chemo brain sucks yeah.. you'll learn to adjust your life around it. That's the thing... I don't wanna be alive but I don't exactly have a choice. I found my new self a couple months ago well I guess I still am and I'm learning my limits with a lot of things. Thx for the advice!The same thing is happening to me (also 17) but with my great grandma. She's constantly asking me if I ate and what I ate. Then when I tell her I already ate she argues that I didn't because she didn't see me eat. She sleeps all day so by the time she's getting up I'm going to sleep so how the hell does she know if I ate or not. She's always saying I need to eat healthier in case the cancer comes back. Who in their right mind would say that to a cancer survivor. And the thing is I do eat healthy but sometimes I'll eat snacks after a meal or get a pizza for dinner. And even when I go out with my Dad she'll say it's cold out there I need a jacket or it's too hot to be outside today. I LOOK AT THE WEATHER EVERY SINGLE TIME BEFORE I LEAVE THE HOUSE, I PLAN MY OUTFITS ACCORDING TO THE WEATHER. She never goes outside so she doesn't even know how it feels out there. It's gotten to the point that I don't even talk to her anymore, I ignore her now because I can't stand her opinions. My Dad has told her multiple times that she's too pushy and needs to stop telling me what to do because I can take care of myself. Everyday my Dad will ask me how I'm feeling and if I ate which I don't mind because he's not pushy with it. He doesn't argue with me on it like my great grandma does and the only reason he asks me if I ate is because he'll get me something from the store if I didn't. Anyways I'm moving out very soon because I can't stand the way she treats me, you should move out too if it's affecting your mental health.Maybe you have chemo brain.The thought of getting it again scares me too. You should look into therapy or support groups. Hopefully everything works out for you! If you wanna talk you can pm me I'd be happy to listen.Wow it's nice to know there's someone out there that was in my exact situation and made it out to be happy. Thank you for the advice it really helps. Lately I've just been here, not happy or sad just here and I don't wanna go to therapy because those people won't understand since they've never had cancer so I've been in cancer support groups which help a little bit. Everyone around me is happy I beat cancer and keeps congratulating me which is very annoying. I hate when people do that or even bring it up, I wish people would forget about it. I feel like a completely different person, my mindset has changed, my body has changed, nothing about is the same which is fine. But anyways thank you for responding 😊Everything that you said makes so much sense, you become a different person after almost dying. I too understand how valuable life is and how fast it can be taken away. I see the world differently now. I'm glad you're doing better 💜Yes it'll take a long time to feel back normal again which I'm sad about because I want to be a firefighter and I know that'll hold me back. I've cut a lot of people outta my life from that time. It's just the people I live with that don't understand it's hard for me to talk about that period in my life so they constantly bring it up. I'll be setting boundaries soon though.Thank you for responding to my post because now I know I'm not the only one feeling like this lolThank you those are some very wise wordsI have new hobbies now so that's a start.I don't think anything be will back normal again, I'm currently writing a book about it actually. My symptoms are: My voice has changed it's more scratchy. My toe nails are black my finger nails are back to it's normal color. I'm in constant pain all over my body. My chest hurts where I had surgery (port placement) so I can't wear bras anymore . The worst of it all is the chemo brain, I had to stop studying to become a firefighter because I can't remember anything and can't focus on things for long. And I'm sure I'm missing more but that's all I can't think of right nowEvery cancer survivor knows that when you're physical free you're not mentally and emotionally free. One of the hardest things I'm dealing with right now is my great grandma, she keeps bringing up my cancer anytime she gets. Constantly talking about how it was so hard on me and how my family abandoned me during that time. It's like she's purposely reminding me about the most traumatic experience in my life so that's definitely a trigger. Thank you stranger 💜I was diagnosed with hodgkins lymphoma last year, I'm now cancer free and my doctors said the same thing. ""If there's any cancer to get it would be this one because it's curable"" I've since hated that people say it's the ""good cancer"" because there's no such thing as a good cancer, cancer all around is bad. I don't even feel like I'm cancer free, I'm still in pain and nothing is back to how it used to be before I got sick.I had hodgkins lymphoma at age 17 (last year) and the whole time I didn't process that any day could be my last. Everyone says I'm strong but I'm not all I did was stay alive which is what people do everyone. So I don't see how I'm special. I don't even feel like an survivor because nothing has really changed. I'm still in pain, I'm still weak. Everything has changed. Nothing is how it used to be before I got sick.I plan to get one this year, it'll be my first tattoo",655,0,0,"['start', 'the', 'day', 'i', 'cancer', 'freeyea', 'everyone', 'different', 'experience',

220,EquipmentLive4770,Doctors absolutely sucks sometimes. I get it the majority of the time you hear hooves it's a horse but sometimes it's a zebra.

224,ExpensiveDust5,"I finished my ALL treatment when I turned 17, so didn't get that as much, but I do know what you mean. There really isn't anything you can do, short of making it a legal matter, which I don't think would be a good idea considering your age. No matter how old you get, no matter how healthy you are, all they will ever see is that sick kid in the hospital bed. This is the reason why I do not tell people about my past until I absolutely need to, because it changes the way people look at me, and I hate it when people feel sorry for me. My best suggestion is: just ride it out a couple more years, but if at all possible, move as soon as you graduate/turn 18/etc. Just get away from them. Parents don't understand that the empathy they still hold from you being sick is just as toxic as being in an abusive family.Good luck, I have days where I literally cannot think, and have been off treatment since 2001. Methotrexate and Daunorubicin were what I was on from 95-01.21 years ""cured"" from ALL, and all I can say is it took me a long time to really get a grasp of who I was, what I can do, and where I fit in to the world. Still not fully there, but I found what I enjoy doing the most is helping everyone I possibly can with whatever the situation they are in. That has landed me many different jobs, mechanic, security, demolition, and currently head of Maintenance for a beach rental company. Everyone struggles with ""what is my purpose in life"" and I feel that is even harder for a cancer survivor, because we have gone through so much more than most people, and learned more than most people ever will. I finished my treatment at 18 years old, but never really felt like I needed a companion in life until I met my wife at 30. You'll find your place, just be patient. It doesn't always just fall into place, but it will come to you eventually. That being said, put yourself out there. And my biggest advice I can give is: Don't make your entire life about cancer and how you survived. Yes, use it as fuel for motivating you to push harder, but IMHO, when talking to people, or applying for a job, if you open with ""I'm a cancer Survivor"" the first reaction normal people have is pity. That is why most people I meet either never know I survived cancer, or they find out WAY later on.Chemo brain, phantom pains, dizziness, feel weak, sometimes I have to fight just to get the strength to get out of bed sometimes, and my ""cure"" date was March 2001, 22 years ago. (39M with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or that's what it was called in 1995) I got the ""3 years of hell"" from 11-14. There are days when I feel like I'm walking on air, and can move easily, then there's days when I feel like I have to turn it up to 200% just to be ""normal"" and it's hard, super hard. I've learned to just power through the hard days, and hope the next day will be better. The phantom pains can be extremely painful sometimes, to the point where they bring me to my knees, mainly in my front thighs where I got Methotrexate-7 shots in each leg, twice a month for the 3 years, and chest pains where my Hickman catheter was for 6 years! Sometimes my spine hurts in my lower back around where I got my twice a week Spinal taps. I probably have blood sugar issues because diabetes runs on both sides of my family, but I never get checked or check it myself, nor do I check my blood pressure. One thing I hope they warned you about was the possibility of bone density loss, and the increased chance of your teeth decaying earlier than normal. Mine look like I'm a meth addict (never done drugs, so not the case). Make sure to go to the dentist FREQUENTLY, or your teeth won't last!

And now she’s the only family member I speak to. Some people just react super weird to it. And you never know which ones. A girl I went to middle school with has become my best supporter. She had a rare type of brain cancer a while back, and when she heard I was going to MD Anderson, she reached out to me. That’s where she had gone. We hadn’t spoken in 30+ years (I was 49 when I was diagnosed), and now we speak almost everyday. Who you tell and when is 100% up to you. You don’t have to do or say anything.

226,Express_Fuel_5771,"I work in pediatric radiology and have 2 kids of my own! When I’m not wearing my cochlear implants, I struggle SO much more to hear and understand them than I do to understand my husband. Have you tried hearing aids? I’d consider researching cochlear implants to see if you would be interested in going that route. Hearing aids did nothing for me. I have tinnitus, as well as high frequency loss. I am diagnosed bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss. I couldn’t live without my cochlear implants. In normal conversation with my hearing, I comprehend less than 20% of words. With my implants on, I comprehend 90-95%. They’re also Bluetooth capable and connect to my phone so it makes phone calls so much easier. I’m young too (33) and they changed my life when I got them at 26.How long has it been since you stopped treatment?Sorry to hear about your kidneys! Was that a side effect you saw pretty immediately? I definitely cannot hear high pitch sounds. I struggle with low pitches, but I think it is mostly because of the tinnitus. My tinnitus is loud and a combination of several different ringing and buzzing tones. When I don’t wear my cochlear implants, I can hear slightly. It doesn’t sound like I’m underwater, maybe more like I’m in a tunnel and they’re standing at the other end talking at normal volume. I struggled bad with my hearing for 7 years before I got cochlear implants. Hearing aids made no difference. The volume is definitely an issue, but more-so clarification. With my implants, I hear and comprehend approximately 95% in conversation, even with background noise. They’re a god send. I just worry that my retained normal hearing will continue to decline and that one day, I will be completely deaf.How old are you now? Do you think your hearing loss is about the same directly post trauma as it is now or is it better/worse? Do you wear any type of aid?I tried hearing aids as well! They didn’t do much at all for me. After 7 years, I got my first cochlear implant. After 9 years, I got my second. I’m almost 15 years out now and my “natural hearing” without my cochlear implants on has declined since my initial audiogram.I only receiving Cisplatin in my last two rounds of chemo. After the first round, the tinnitus started but went away within a week. After the second round, roaring tinnitus that never left.

Years ago, I remember I read a book, wrote by a mother who was diagnosed with Cancer when she was pregnant. The book is about all the things she wanted to tell her daughter, a little bit about how to face life years by years without her. I know write a book isn't as easy and not for everyone, but maybe you can make an email address, everyday (or once a week, twice a week, whenever you like) wrote what you want to say to your son and send it to that email. You can also send photos, videos, etc. Once your son is old enough, I hope he can feel your presence through those digital memories. You can talk to him through it. Video is very great! Record yourself talking to him, whatever you want to tell him, hug him, kiss him. Then send the video to the email. You can also make another email for your husband. Or put them together in one email (both for your son and husband).Thank you, you are so kind. ☺️Thank you, you are so kind. I know people don't know what to say, I don't blame them. My emotions are just not good. My eyes are puffy from crying and everything feels so heavy.We had a very serious conversation a few days ago, he expressed that he's too tired now and realized that he have no good quality of life.

233,Faunas-bestie,"How are you doing now?In Feb. of 2023, I was doing yoga and kept feeling a lump like I was sitting on a walnut. I told my doctor and he dismissed it as a pulled muscle, which I kind of agreed with. In May I insisted on an MRI. 25 rounds of radiation, resection of a 4 x 4 cm spindle cell sarcoma, Mets to my lungs, and six rounds of Doxorubicin and Ifosfamide all in hospital left me feeling healthy and cured by April of 2024. Cut to August 7th and a chest CT came back with new and worsening lung Mets. Still stage 4 and about to start maintenance chemo for life.What did they find?I did six rounds of the “red devil” doxorubicin and ifosfamide. My team well handled my nausea so it wasn’t a concern for me at all. Fatigue and low blood counts wiped me out, but I would always bounce back. Eat well and whatever you can tolerate. My taste’s temporarily changed where things I loved tasted awful, but novel things and food from my childhood were okay and my taste for my favorites returned at the end of each cycle. All my infusions were five days of hospitalization for each of my six rounds. I made sure I exercised and did laps around the halls every day. It’s very important to get up and walk around even when you don’t want to. It really helps. It’s not as bad as you think. Lots of people get through it and believe me, you’re as tough as they are.From what I’ve learned, there’s a difference between a “survivor” and what some call themselves, a “thriver”. Survivors seem to go from a stage 4 diagnosis to either remission or NED and enjoy that status (or worry about recurrence) for years and years. Maybe it goes away for good and they can never really believe their good fortune. The self-described “thrivers” are those who go through maintenance chemo or “chemo for life” and cycle on and off treatment. This is my situation it would seem. My prognosis is four years, give or take, but I hope to last longer to watch my grandchildren grow up a bit. A cure is not currently an option, but shrinkage of lung Mets or stability of the same, is the hope.I am stage 4 metastatic soft tissue sarcoma with lung nodules. After finding my lung nodules and determining they were metastatic disease, I had six rounds of doxorubicin and ifosfamide and they basically disappeared. Five months later, they came back with a vengeance. The good news is the ones I have are all at or close to 1 CM, and these are considered small. Check if they sized any of your nodules. Anything under a centimeter is still very small. Also, if you haven’t talked to your care team yet, take a deep breath and relax. My new mantra is “Don’t freak out till you find out”. I know this is worrisome, but you’ll have plenty of time to worry after they do a biopsy. My history tells me if the nodules are small, they may ask you to wait 3 months to do another CT scan, to see if they’ve grown. Most people find the nodules are behaving and you can then decide if you want radiation or surgery. You have plenty of time, my friend. Breast cancer is the most well-researched and supported cancer there is. There are so many more treatments and chemos available to you that have been tested and effective.

237,FeralTee,"🎉🎉🎉. That's wonderful to hear! Always brings a smile to my face when I see that NED.... looking forward to it myself!!54 here. I used to be chubby but a powerhouse. I was strong!! Open abdominal surgery and cancer have helped make me weak.. I don't know what my outcome will be but if I can get through this with some hope for a future.. I truly hope to get some of that back.. My strength.. My endurance.. My ability to stand/walk for hours.. My brain.. And yes.. I hear you. I am never great these days but some are definitely worse than others. ""This too shall pass"" is becoming my daily mantra! 🤔😜💕 I'm sorry your plate is so full.. Cancer itself is overwhelming at times (most of the time when I allow myself to think about it!). Relationships often change because of cancer.. As does the need to focus on what the future might look like.. For everyone involved. Sending hopes for positive outcomes in both arenas. Losing a beloved pet on top of everything... Three summers we lost our beloved oversized fluff ball. We had a good long time with him but it's never easy to recover from loss. We have a new character in our lives.. He's middle aged and full of sweetness. I'm not sure what my future looks like but I know I couldn't face it without the unconditional love from a pet. Sending you wishes for best possible health and happiness! 💕I'm very sorry to hear your news. I am not terribly enlightened with everything regarding cancer, even my own cancer.. Though I research quite a bit! I hope there is someone with some answers for you! Sending warm thoughts and wishes for best possible health and happiness! 💕I'm terribly sorry this is happening to you. Sending you positive thoughts and best wishes for recovery, best possible health, and happiness. Getting the diagnosis sucks... Dealing with cancer sucks.. But it's important to find your reasons to enjoy whatever you can.. It makes life worth living. 💕I'm still in this position. Still having sudden ups and downs. I think the worst thing is the hope.. Yes, I know how that might sound.. Worst outcome means no more worrying.. Wondering.. I hate that I can even think that. My surgeon told me to expect just over half a year to possibly as much as three to five years. I was broken after hearing that. I couldn't function and still have difficulty when I think about it. My oncologist told me he wouldn't guess about timelines. He has given me a bit of hope.. There are survivors (depending on the study..) 55%..or 37%..the 15%..or the 2%.. If I go by the studies and papers.. I'm in the 2%. It's easy to slip into worst outcome scenarios. But i am doing my best to see all the positives.. I watch my blood work like a hawk and calculate some equations that are shown to indicate prognosis. If something is slipping, I do my best to try and right it. The rabbit holes are out there.. Lol.. And I slip down them pretty often!! I just try and stay away from the papers/studies that are primarily about overall survival.

At no point was I told, nor did I ever really think, that death was a possibility. It was just half a year of chemo then a lot of recovery. The chances of it coming back are very slim. I still feel weird about the word 'survivor', as well as the thought of having 'beaten cancer'. All I did was turn up to hospital every 2 weeks so that doctors could put a bunch of chemicals into my body. What I've learned over the last few years, however, is that there's different ways of 'surviving'. Sure, death wasn't ever on the horizon for me, but I what DID survive was the mental, physical and emotional stresses that the whole experience puts you through. It completely shakes up your world and how you view life, and all of that has the potential to crush you. It absolutely messed with my mental health as well, and god knows I'm still working through it, but I'm here! I haven't let the cancer beat me completely, because I'm still here, and I'm somewhat okay!

254,Full_Spell297,"I am 53 and he is 50, together for 16 years, married for 14 as of this month. Early this year I was diagnosed with breast cancer. We scheduled my chemo days for the his regular day off from work every week. He would bring me to the infusion center, so they could access my port and draw blood, then we would see the oncologist and review things, then he would help me get settled back at the infusion center for my chemo treatments. He would then leave to run errands and take care of our dogs And I would text him when I was almost finished and he would come and pick me up. We did not take any vacation obviously because of the chemo but also because he wants to use those days to be here for me when I have my surgery.

I am focusing on recovery even though I still need to have surgery immunotherapy and radiation therapy. I am planning a big party for when I’m cancer free.

257,GameofCheese,"I'm gonna paste something I wrote in a different post. I think it fits here too... Taking control of your quality of life by choosing to end treatments is brave and can make a horrible end a nicer one with less pain, more family, and maybe some last adventures. Choosing to end treatment is just as valid as doing clinical trials and everything else one can do to try to remove the cancer. No one else can tell any of us what we should or shouldn't do. In my case, it was pure luck we caught it earlyish and it was ""very treatable"" with current medicine. But it was also mere chance that I had shoulder/ neck pain that helped find my last tumor behind my facial sinuses. I don't know, if I had gone longer and it hadn't been discovered for many more years, I might have chosen not to ""fight"" and simply enjoy the time I had. We're all different, every case is different, every family is different. No choices are fit for everyone. There is nothing wrong with picking and choosing what actions you want to take on this journey. It's your journey, no one else's. There is a lot of beauty in choosing your final days. Most people never get to do that. As a culture we are terribly naive about medicine and death. I worked in a children's hospital and honestly some of the best gifts a parent can give a child is a gentle passing. There is nothing wrong with that. Medicine can only do so much.

Just keep drinking water and let your spouse or partner that maybe shouldn't cook anything strong smell. I feel bad but my wife made bacon and I woke up. Went to bathroom and just there for hours. I told her that she needs to cook somewhere else. I felt bad but I was terribly sick and just stomach acid came out it was worse feeling. I have brain so it could be differentWell we been through a lot when I lost my job and when she lost hers. The treatment was terrible and I be honest she kinda made it bad a lot of times. I give some examples. Chemo and radiation it happened a few times not just once. When I was going to surgery our ride ended up getting covid well instead of her driving or me she begged her brother to take us. (Surgery) When it was snowing and not bad she wouldn't let me leave to get treatment. She was like wait for snow to stop well it did like 4 hours later and the roads where worse. I also had to call in for work that day. (Radiation) I was getting sick from chemo and she knows that bacon really bothers me even the smell does. Well she did it a few times where I woke up just to go throw up. I told her can she please not cook bacon or anything like that during chemo. (Chemo)I am 32 was diagnosed at 30. I changed a little bit. I am like to live my life and be happy every day. Before I wasn't just a puppet going through life now I just want to enjoy it I have grade 3 brain cancer.

262,Glittering_Hurry236,"I’m sorry for your cancer. So very very sorry. ❤️‍🩹 There is a special kind of evil and mental illness for people like your mother and both of my parents. Normal people cannot wrap their minds around - making life worse or harder for a cancer ridden child of any age .. but they are so narcissistic and self-absorbed that they literally don’t care. I hope you have all of the support and there are miracles and I will hope and pray you are one of them 🙏🏻 Cancer just hearing you have it. And don’t know the stage immediately is terrifying - for months until you find out - and I got lucky 🙏🏻 I staged well. But it’s cancer. Anything can happen. You have to be a special brand of evil to make someone’s life even harder when they have cancer. It’s really sick. These people are truly sick. Your mother included. I’m glad you didn’t visit her. She didn’t deserve it. ❤️‍🩹Yes. It’s their loss. I’m sorry they are terrible people. I’m also so sorry there has been a reoccurrence and I’m hoping you can nip it in the bud quickly, please don’t stress yourself out too much about DCF and the kids - that will work itself out. You need to get your health back. Tell them nothing moving forward about your kids. They do not care. My children receive nothing from my father and his second wife on their birthdays or Christmas and my sister‘s kids get cars, laptops, iPhones, condos and trips; so it has been passed down to my children the hatred - and the good news is that my 12-year-old does not know my dad or his disgusting wife. He’s only met him once, and he doesn’t know he doesn’t get gifts from them. They don’t occur to my younger child because I shielded him from them. Unfortunately I couldn’t shield my older child - they know they’ve been shunned/hated/ignored. Because my sister’s children (my older and the cousins are all well into their 20’s) so the cousins would gleefully call my older child and tell them all about the presents they got for Christmas/birthday’s from their rich grandpa and my child would ask me what they got from their rich grandpa and I would say “nothing. He got you nothing I’m sorry.” I knew better than to tell my parents I had cancer - and I had discussed in therapy that I wasn’t going to tell them because they would not offer any support emotional, physical or financial and my therapist was very clear. “Do not tell them if they cannot support you in anyway it will just upset you because they will be showing you for the last time that they do not care about you so be prepared for that,” and I didn’t tell them until a couple days before my surgery because I couldn’t fathom one of my children having cancer and about to undergo surgery and me, not knowing about it. But my gut instinct was not to tell them and that was correct and I’ll never do it again. Your mother is exactly like my dad. He got kudos for helping his sister, and helping his ex-wife and he wouldn’t get enough kudos for helping his own daughter so he decided not to and that’s fine. He doesn’t have to, but you were right to say what you said to your mom she didn’t make me she doesn’t care my mother never made me, flat on my back for two weeks barely move for a month. My mother called me the last three days in a row and she hasn’t called me since June and my surgery was May 29 and I was thinking yesterday why would she call me three days in a row? What does she want? I didn’t take any of her calls and then I decided it’s go time so when she called she starts going into her stupidity and I just started screaming and I was spitting seething with hatred on the phone and called her and my dad and my sister every name in the book and said you’re disgusting. You’re the most disgusting people I’ve ever met. I spent days and weeks and months by your bedside when all you had was pancreatitis you were barely sick, and your daughter has cancer and you never even made me a meal HOW dare you! And then I hung up because I was like you know what I’m only 10 1/2 weeks postop. I don’t need this. I don’t need a recurrence of cancer because the body keeps score and I just have to let it go. And you have to let it go. And you even have to let fights with DCF go because the body keeps score and when you have a family of origin that hates you this much eats and we have cancer… We have to let go of the people that hate us and STOP trying. Stop taking the bait and just drop the rope. I would say in your case and in my case, there’s nothing left to salvage and I’m not interested in pleasantries with whatever time I have left in my life. I could get run over by a bus tomorrow. I could have a reoccurrence who knows nobody knows, but I’m not wasting another second on people who literally don’t care if I live or die. Be well and thank you for your comment ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹🙏🏻Yes I have my husband tho we have been separated for many years. We are best friends; he took me to all doctors appts and surgery stayed all day., we are raising our 12 year old together and well. I have handful of best friends that called weekly daily - sent fruit and actually cared whether I lived died or how I staged and I went into therapy since the diagnosis - as I was so terrified of the c word and the staging possibilities and the surgery and recovery - so. I’ll continue with therapy. A couple weeks ago therapist asked me if my parents had been supportive at all and I said “no actually I haven’t heard from them and my mother is local and because it was a hysterectomy you can’t twist, you can’t bend, you can’t pick anything up. I had groceries delivered and would have to take each piece of groceries out of the bag one by one with my grabber put it in a box kick the box into the kitchen and then take each piece of grocery out of the box with the grabber onto the counter and then put it into the refrigerator, my mother lives five minutes down the street. She never helped me bring the groceries in.” And as I state these facts flatly because I’ve endured nothing but second-class treatment for 50 years. - the therapist took her glasses off and she looked up at me and she said, “I want to tell you that I’m sorry and that that’s not OK and nothing will ever make it right that your parents have not checked on you after you’ve had a cancer diagnosis and surgery nothing will ever make that OK and I’m sorry,” and I said thank you. I pray you stay in remission 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻After I was diagnosed, I started therapy and I had six weeks between diagnosis and the surgery and in therapy. I said I don’t think I’m gonna tell my family or my parents that I have cancer or am having surgery because of how shitty they have been in the past and she was very clear and said do not tell them if they cannot be supportive, and they do not care don’t bother. And a week before the surgery, I thought to myself I can’t imagine either of my children having cancer and going through cancer and life-saving surgery and having their organs staged for cancer grading and not knowing about it so I stupidly told my parents about it and my mom was like oh OK and didn’t call me for a week. Didn’t care. I was going in for surgery and was like got surgery tomorrow. And she says call me when it’s over. And I hung up. I tell my dad I have cancer and need surgery and he’s all “I’m sure you’ll do great and let me know if you need anything and I’m always here for you.” Proceeds to call me just once the night of the surgery to make sure I survived the table I guess and I never heard from him again. Asked for help on the hospital bills as he’s helped out his ex wife, his sister and even his 2nd wife’s cousin finding the best cancer team his money could buy (to no avail sadly) and for his own child. I was told nope. Can’t help you. It’s not even not helping financially when he’s helped others. There wasn’t even a text to ask how I’m feeling. It’s beyond comprehension. Yes. Not my monkeys. Not my circus.I’d say oh Jesus but … It’s unbelievable right …. If the narcissist don’t get anything out of it, you don’t matter. I’m sure my parents are getting plenty of narcissistic supply talking about my cancer with their friends. While I haven’t even gotten a single phone call or text from my own father asking me, How are you doing, while he’s probably at a country club somewhere laughing up attention for his cancer ridden daughter … I sat at my mother‘s bedside for months last year when she had a mere pancreatitis attack because she’s refused to give up salt and sodium laden foods while taking a high BP med that has pancreatitis as a severe side effect to the BP med - so she caused her own pancreatic attack and thru no fault of my own I have endometrial cancer even though I had my first child in my 20s. I have zero factors for it. I am slim and petite. I don’t eat sugar, but it’s clearly in my father side of the family as his mother and his sister died at 55 of alleged colon cancer..my ONC said my guess is it didn’t start in their colons…Yes, I agree with you 100%, when my mother had her pancreatitis attack. Her dog needed to be put down and my sister refused to do it so I had to do it while mother was milking it that she was so weak she needed 24/7 hour nursing care. It was a pancreatitis attack. It was not cancer, it was not a heart attack, it was not heart surgery. It was not brain surgery…it was NO surgery. But it’s how she decided to gain attention for herself. When it was actual cancer for me and surgery and I have a 12-year-old to take care of. I didn’t get so much as a meal as I brought her coffees and her favorite sandwiches and visited her daily. I got absolutely nothing of the same two years later. And I will never do another thing for her ever again. Ever.Thank you so much for this response very interesting! Sorry about your cancer. I hope you kick its ass!! Yes, I would think both of my parents had terrible childhoods which I do agree; my father’s mother abandoned him and his siblings to be raised alone by his father in the 50s when that stuff just didn’t happen, and my mother’s mother was an alcoholic who was drunk if she wasn’t at work, and my mother is an only child and extremely self-absorbed and narcissistic and my father was a domineering tyrant CEO Narc type. Lots of yelling and screaming from him when we were kids. I also had a sibling that died when she was 12 to a fatal genetic illness. My other sister was diagnosed with borderline personality when her daughter started showing signs of it in her early teens so my sister is actually a sociopath who has zero empathy and I on the other hand do so I might be the one with cancer, but I am the one that has a full life with friends and my sister doesn’t have a single friend in life besides her husband and she never has. So let the 3 of them be disordered together. You’d think people who lost a child 35 years ago might want to show some caring. But they did the opposite. My sister must be rolling in her grave that they didn’t even care I had cancer. That our mother who lives five minutes down the street from me, couldn’t even help me do laundry or bring in groceries when I couldn’t bend because you can’t do much after a hysterectomy for a long time and neither parent even said how are you doing or how you feeling it was if I didn’t exist just like my dad sibling you know They were glad maybe they were like we’ll get rid of two of them. I don’t know why. When two people have talked of nothing else then how sad they are that one of their children passed away 30 years ago has another child with an illness and they couldn’t care less.Thank you so much for your response ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 I’m sorry you lost your mom 😥 Yes your dad likes the drama of it. I’m sure my mother is telling everybody with ears about her daughter with cancer and how she came over twice leaving out that in 2 1/2 months she’s come over twice each for 10 minutes. As a Gen X I did raise myself. These two are no loss .. But. There’s some part of you that thinks oh I’ve got the big bad now. I actually have cancer. Maybe they’ll give a flying fuck about me because I am sick and then you’re slapped with the reality of nope, still no. Lol I started therapy when I was diagnosed which has been great. My therapist actually told me not to tell my parents because she did not think that they would be supportive because they have proved over and over and over again through my weddings. Yes, I’ve had two of them; and two children and they didn’t care about my kids either that they just don’t care about anything that pertains to me, and she said it’s not gonna be any different just because it’s cancer - they didn’t care when you were having their grandchildren. But, I felt like I have two kids, and I can’t imagine if one of them had cancer and was going through cancer surgery and I didn’t know about it because I’m a normal person so I told them a week before the surgery. And I shouldn’t have bothered and I’ll never tell them another thing about myself or my kids ever again. But. Boundaries are for us. Mine are pretty good, and I’m 2 1/2 months post op now. So I don’t need any help anymore. That’s over … my mother had a chance to help me and chose to ignore me instead. I am driving and can pick up heavy grocery bags and am back in the gym. It’s slow but I’m getting better daily. Thankfully the surgery seems to have gotten rid of the cancer and no chemo and I am praying it stays that way. God bless you all fighting the fight if it goes on longer … I was diagnosed in April and it’s hard to believe that was 4 + months ago — Like a lifetime ago. So scary. So terrifying. I’ve leaned on my husband and my friends and therapist and PT, who’s also a naturopath. I’ve had the cancer center SW call and I have a great GYN and GP now and it’s all hands on deck. Two people who’ve shown me nothing but contempt for 50 years aren’t my go to. But I thought telling them about the cancer and the surgery was the right thing to do, but my therapist was correct that family of origin members that cannot be supportive of your cancer and your journey and you don’t know what your journey is gonna be until staging so you do what you want - but I’m telling you if these people aren’t supportive it’s just gonna upset you and I was like not really I think they’re gross. This might just put the finalfork in it and did and it was meant to happen for whatever reason. Anything good or decent I ever thought those two (my parents) had in them - I realize that they don’t and they couldn’t even fake it for an adult child with cancer. They just really don’t care and that’s their bag. I lay head on the pillow at night knowing that I’m the best mother that I possibly can be to my kids when they need me and I’m not gonna turn my back on them. Not at any age.All the comments are helpful thank you! And yes the ostrich theory could be in fact - because I had a 12-year-old sister die when we were kids of a genetic illness and I lived my entire childhood taking care of her, as I was 10 when she was born. She died when I was in my 20s and she was 12 so this particular harshness of not helping physically (mother) or financially (father who easily has the means. It’s medical bills. I’m not asking for cars). But, because my parents have acted so broke up over the death of my sibling all these years - now it makes me wonder if they’re glad she’s gone and wished I was gone too because of the absolute lack of interest when I have cancer. Knowing I can’t move or even drive. No help was offered. Can’t do daily tasks as a hysterectomy has you down for the count for a solid 4 weeks. And I’ve really just turned the corner at 10 weeks here. Knowing I have to pick up a 2nd job when the medical bills are mounting…as they frivolously spend $$ for my other sibling and her children. It’s as if they enjoy my suffering and want to make it so I actually do die of stress or get a reoccurrence. That’s how I see it. Thank you 🙏🏻❤️‍🩹I’m so so sorry to hear this. Having kids is a thankless job … My oldest child hasn’t asked me how I was doing either. They are 25. They have asked for money since they were laid off. And I’m still paying off their college loans .. so I get this also. My parents and sibling indoctrinated my older child into the “family way” of Glittering is the family garbage and be mean to her and ignore her and “maybe” we’ll be nice to you. My adult child always jumped on that (they are shunned and hated by my parents, sibling and cousins) so they decided to go on the we hate glittering train a long time ago. But they also live local and have not helped me out at all. I also don’t want it from them as they have their own issues; bipolar like my undiagnosed unmedicated sibling but at least my child takes their meds .. I’m so so sorry you are stage 4. I hope you have some support from husband or friends or chosen family. Are in therapy and can find some time to enjoy yourself in ways your find fulfilling. Cancer is a lonely scary life - stage 4 is another level of scary. I wish you a miracle ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹Thank you so much for your post, yes both of my parents had terrible childhood and they have already had a child passed away at 12 years old my youngest sibling when I was 2022 and she was 12. And that they don’t seem to care about their 50-year-old adult child with cancer kind of tells me that they didn’t really care when my 12-year-old sibling passed away, but they faked it like they did for I guess their own dramatics. I am a much more caring and responsible mother than they and I like you didn’t get my first hug from my mother until I was 40 and it was bizarre and strange because she has had no interest in me as far back as my memory can go. I’m extremely sorry for your son glioblastoma is obviously a worst case scenario, but I will certainly be praying for a miracle !! I’m glad he has the support that you were offering because trust me there’s are those of us without it and even if I had glioblastoma, nobody in my family would have cared… That’s a tough pill to swallow… you own parents hate you and like watching you suffer. It’s so unnatural .. they enjoy my suffering and always have. It’s been a fascinating and despicable case study in sociopathy. While they bend over backwards for my sibling who has treated them horribly and actually stolen from them, you just can’t make sense of it… I wish your son every wish and good will and miracle

My Grandfather died just two weeks after his diagnosis. We were told a month to three months at most. Similarly to your Dad, we also thought my Grandfather had a stroke. But no, it was metastatic brain tumours too. They found tumours basically everywhere they could’ve been found. Too late for any type of treatment. Was only in his 60s, and had just retired a year before after a long and hard 40+ years of work doing labour intensive jobs, so it should have been his time to put his feet up and enjoy the fruits of his labour… but no.

267,GraymaneGent,"51 and out of my last chemo cycle for a month tomorrow, still have to go through surgery next month. I feel like the ghost of my old self, always moving, Always up to something, never caring about akes and pain untill they prevented me to reach my objectives. Now I feel weack, physical fatigue Is the new standard condition, struggling to focus on any mildly complex intellectual task, and scrutinising every new pain and sensation with fear. Here Is when will power needs to kick in, I'm forcing myself to push my limits a little bit (almost) every day. I try to walk longer everyday, may It be just to go to buy bread at the bakery down the road or to the post office etc. Being fortunate enough to be at my parents house in a costal town by the sea for this entire month, I try to swim 5 mitutes longer each day to regain muscle tone and stamina. I force myself to read at least 20 pages of a book every day to regain the ability to focus and do sudoku, crosswords or some kind of puzzle game or build and paint model kits for half and hour to regain problem solving ability and witt. I try to meet with people as often as possible, to regain social skills lost during the long time spent in hospital pitting myself and becoming angry at the entire world. Willpower is everything, things may not go as hoped in the future, but I will noy let every again cancer kill my spirit and witt before it kills my body!Great news, its so encouraging reading about remissione and healing front time to time.

270,Greeeto,"I’m sorry you’re in this situation. It is awful. I hope you are healing well from surgery. 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at 42 years old. My parents, like yours, are also in their 70s, in good health, and never have had cancer. There’s so much backstory, but basically my parents wanted to have my cancer fit their lives regardless of what my oncologist said and advised. I realized they were willing to put my life in jeopardy during treatment in order for them to somehow make my cancer about them. I learned that they cared even less if I live or die than I even thought before. I also learned that they were willing to go out of their way to hurt me and my children (11 & 13) when they didn’t get their way. So, I did the only thing I could which is go no contact. This is after my brother and I tried so many things: therapy, mediation, face to face convos, written letters, logical conversations, emotional conversations, etc. I had to face the fact that they don’t want to have a relationship with me where I am valued, respected, or even considered. They want me and my children as their possessions. Fortunately I live 3 states away and it makes the logistics of no contact a little easier. I totally empathize with you on being in a weird place realizing that your parents hate you.

307,Impressive_Course_44,"I completely agree with your post. As you mentioned its up to each individual. I liked the “you got this” phrase. My wife and I used it a lot.

Like I have to go in every day for proton treatment, as the side effects start to build up, it can be tedious.

I never used that phrase with him. I let him lead the way in how we discussed his cancer. He was the most positive guy you would have ever met. He faced his condition with a smile on his face, knowing that he only had a few months to a couple of years at best. Luckily he survived more in the year and a half or so range with a great quality of life all for except the last couple of weeks.

325,JHutchinson1324,"Hello, I was diagnosed with stage IV anaplastic large cell lymphoma at the end of 2019. I was given the best prognosis of 50/50 to make it 2 years with treatment. I went through treatment, I had a stem cell transplant, and now I am still here four plus years after my transplant and almost five years since my diagnosis at the end of this year. I have a very long post from 2019 with all of the details of what happened and how and when if you want to read through that, it's very long though so I'll just kind of hit some of the highlights here. For ten months I had an unexplained itch all over my body and I was having excruciating back pains. My doctor continuously told me that I was being dramatic, or imagining things, or that my house was dirty, or that my dogs were dirty, or just anything for him to not have to do any actual work for me. I woke up one morning completely paralyzed from the waist down so I checked myself into the emergency room and luckily they found all of the tumors on my spine and in my hip. I had four broken vertebrae and my left hip was broken all from tumors growing in those bones. I was told at this time that if I hadn't checked myself into the ER or if we hadn't actually caught the cancer I probably would have been dead in two weeks or so from the tumors completely strangling my nervous system and shutting down my body. I had ten rounds of targeted radiation on all five of my tumors and luckily they shrank to almost nothing. At that point I got a little bit of feeling back from the waist down but it's pins and needles neuropathy, even today this is permanent, so it feels like when you sit on the toilet for too long and your legs go numb. I will say it's not as bad in my waist area as it is in my feet, I feel slight numbness around my hips but then the numbness and the pins and needles exponentially increases as it goes down my body so that my feet are not completely numb but at that point to where they are super sensitive from the pins and needles. Even when my dog accidentally steps on my foot it almost sends me through the roof cuz it hurts so bad. I was in a wheelchair from all of this but because I need to walk to take care of myself because my caregiver is not actually useful or reliable, I taught myself how to walk again. I currently walk with a cane but I did walk with a rollator there for a little while in the middle and it helped a lot with my balance. After radiation I had six rounds of R-CHOP chemotherapy. it went pretty well and at the halfway mark we did a scan and everything seemed to be working so we continued with the other cycles. I was told that at that scan if the treatments were not working we would not have continued on that route and I guess something else would have been done. Now, I don't know, it's possible that they would have just told me that there was nothing they could do but I didn't ask what the alternative would have been because I didn't want to really think about that at that point. I finished my chemotherapy in March of 2020. I was told from almost the beginning that they would want to give me a stem cell transplant if my chemotherapy worked and I was able to get into remission. This wasn't mentioned until quite a ways into my treatment because I think they were waiting to see if it was even a possibility for me to get into remission. From what I understand that was one of the requirements of the stem cell transplant was being NED. So I was supposed to get my stem cell transplant in June I think or may of 2020 but it was during the height of covid and I was really afraid so I did push it back a little bit, it also helps that I was having a very hard time recovering from chemotherapy so they also thought that it might have benefited me to have a little bit of extra time in between. We started all of the prep for the transplant in June and I checked myself into the hospital for the actual procedure July 10th of 2020, one day before my 34th birthday. I had an auto transplant so I feel like I was lucky in that I didn't have to deal with a lot of the other issues that come with transplants like gvhd. I was in the hospital I think 24 or 25 days and then once my immune system rebounded enough for them to release me I was sent home. Typically I would have stayed around the hospital, I had my transplant about 2 hours from my home, but because this was covid and they didn't want me staying in a hotel they sent me all the way home and just discharged me to my regular oncologist. I'm pretty sure that normally at this point you get a lot of support but because of covid I had absolutely no support, and I was just told to follow up with my regular oncologist which I've done but I'm not sure what I missed out on here and what might actually occur for somebody getting a transplant outside of a pandemic. I think for the first year I had scans every 3 months and then we went to every 6 months and after year 3 I haven't had a scan and I expect to have one at my 5th year mark next summer. I've been told that even though my lymphoma is technically uncurable that if I am able to stay in remission for 5 years I will be considered medically cured. And holy hell I said I was going to hit the highlights, and this is still ridiculously long I'm so sorry. It's just you know there's a lot involved. If you have any specific questions I can definitely answer or if you want me to expand on anything I can do that too, I just don't want to make this a 1,000 page novel lol",545,0,0,"['start', 'hello',

Now I’m supposed to be moving on and I can’t. Treatment traumatized me. I am mourning the person I once was while almost dealing with ptsd from treatment. I wasn’t prepared for the after effects no one told me about. I have no answers but you are not alone.Yes, that’s another thing, I never stopped working. I worked very full time through treatment. I only missed two days when chemo kicked my ass I couldn’t find the strength. I was remote for most of my treatment them back in office once I finished. I never rested, I never got a chance to absorb the fact I have cancer. I feel like it’s hitting me now that I’m not in panic mode. I’m working on a new oncology team. My insurance is terrible.

332,JenovaCelestia,"I’m almost 7 years out from my last chemo infusion and rads, and while I don’t feel perpetually sick, I do feel exhausted all the time and like I’m in my 80s. What’s more, chemo made my previously undiagnosed ADHD worse to the point I need to be on meds to manage it. I am also menopausal now and will never have human kids biologically. All of that being what it is, when I get sick, I get SICK. My immune system definitely has taken a hit and I get bronchitis at least once a year now. Nothing I can do about it; it is what it is. 🤷🏻‍♀️I was 26 when I was diagnosed. I’m 33 now. When I was diagnosed, I had gotten 6 months prior. I was working as a full-time supervisor in a grocery store and was gunning to make assistant manager. Not super lofty goals, but I was content with the company I worked for and was wanting to move up. Then I get diagnosed, fight cancer, then come back to work. During my treatments, I had to use a walker to walk around. At that point, my mobility was getting better and better and I was using a cane. Eventually I was able to walk unassisted… until about July. The prevailing theory right now is the chemo and/or rads weakened my legs. I had to go through intense physio to bring the strength back and even then, my legs haven’t been the same since. I faced a lot of ableism at work. The final straw was in December 2020. I had called in sick due to my legs and the idiot HR rep we had demanded a COVID test, despite me explaining that I don’t have respiratory symptoms and my symptoms are exactly as indicated in the multitude of doctor’s notes I brought in. The HR rep said word-for-word “you’re cured so you’re fine now”. I should have sued, but I made the decision to go back to school and get a better job. I’d go back to school January 2022, quit that job February 2022, and I’d graduate April 2023. What did I go back to school for? Medical office admin. And I now work at the same outpatient cancer facility that I received treatment. To answer the question, cancer isn’t the end and can be a new beginning.

333,Jmtb3601,"I’m on Carboplatin + Alimta + Keytruda and the pharmacist at MD Anderson who went over all the meds and side effects told me that the B12 shot I would receive at my treatment as well as the anti-naseau meds would hold up through the first couple of days and the B12 and corticosteroids I take on day 2, 3 and 4 after chemo would keep my energy up and inflammation down. I was like the energizer bunny for the first two days (also couldn’t sleep). She also told me the fatigue from Keytruda would likely be felt on week 2. Outside of having to take zofran on day three (had an unsettled stomach), she was spot on. Also be prepared for a rash, super dry skin, AND constipation (Miralax). Week three was pretty smooth and much more energy. Hope this helps.As a mom who was just diagnosed with NSCLC, I would want you to be happy and please go back to school. She would want that for you. Carry all the good memories you made with her always and try talking about those. If she was in hospice, some counseling should be provided to the family for the first year afterwards; please find out and take advantage of that to help you deal with the painful experiences you witnessed.

Every chemo, medication reaction, the seizure I got some odd reason had during an MRI, the side effects from chemo, being stuck in the hospital for weeks, just being away from your normal, the many and any lumbar punctures I have to have. The mental, emotional, and physical trauma is there for me and it’s only been a month in. I know there will be more to come.

I hope that you get better and can move past this♥️I always had issues with iron deficiency, but one day my tests came back way the opposite. I then started getting my blood tested almost every week. Just my CBC because I knew something was wrong. That’s where I kept seeing my WBC, RBCS, and HGB just tank. I stayed tired a lot, couldn’t breathe, running fevers. Eventually I saw that I was neutropenia. Then camp the first of many blood transfusions. Saw an oncologist immediately on a Friday for a bone marrow biopsy, got the news that evening I had acute leukemia. Admitted to the hospital that night and started chemo that Monday. Been a month of chemo so far. Has not been fun but leukemia kills fast so I’m not too mad at the moment.35 F diagnosed with B cell Leukemia.I had a blood transfusion on a Tuesday and was referred to an oncologist and was told it wouldn’t be until the next week before I could get an appointment, luckily I had was able to be seen that Friday. Got a bone marrow biopsy and diagnosed with Acute Leukemia that evening. Admitted to the hospital that night and started chemo that Monday. My cancer is very aggressive and was very fortunate to be seen so quickly because I literally was dying. Still had to wait for testing to come back for them to know exactly what they were dealing with and exact treatment but chemo had to be started quickly. Definitely be on a cancellation list that can help.I was diagnosed with B Cell Leukemia at 35 at the end of July 2024. Still feels like I’m way too young for this.

I also lost my job even though they let me work remotely when I broke my leg and ankle on the job. Now they are begging me to come back to work remotely because they can’t find anyone else to do the job as well as I did their words not mine! Of course it could be something to do with being sued for not offering FMLA to a cancer patient etc. I couldn’t do the job now anyways due to the severe pain and sickness etc of this cancer.

353,Knitting_Octopus3791,"Every word of your post, except for your age, is something I might have written ten years ago. I (now 33F) was diagnosed with stage 3 Hodgkins at 22. I went into remission at 23. Fortunately, I've been cancer free since then and have gone on to have a great life after cancer. After I learned I was in remission, I felt sad and lost for a long time. I thought I ""should"" be happy to be alive and cancer-free, but like you said, nothing was normal, and day-to-day living felt just weird. Plus I had a lot of angst about what I was doing with my life and struggling to envision the future. All those feelings caught me by surprise because here I was cancer free, just like I wanted to be, and why couldn't I enjoy it? For me, though, there were valuable things that came out all the soul-searching I did during that really tough time. Before my diagnosis, I was positive I wanted to pursue a particular career that I was super excited about, and I'd just started on a big new chapter. During my treatment I decided to leave that field, though I had no idea what to do instead. After a few aimless years of not really wanting to do anything, I eventually settled on my current career, which I love and which is absolutely a better fit for me. Therapy helped me. Also giving myself lots of emotional space to feel my feelings without judging them. But I think for me what helped the most was just the passage of time, accumulating more and more life experiences, and getting to live a life that I love. Somewhere along the line, cancer went from being this behemoth that defined everything to being a part of my past that was awful but shaped who I became afterward. (Not that it's 100% in the past--there are still medical and emotional effects--but it feels more like a thing of the past than a thing of the present.) And today I am grateful beyond words that I beat cancer, though it took a long time before I genuinely felt that way. I'm afraid I sound like I'm romanticizing cancer--I'm not. The whole thing sucks beyond suckiness. It's not that I'm glad I had it, but I am glad about some of the choices I made afterward. And I'm very, very glad I ended up alive and where I am--much as I wish I could have gotten here in a different way. Anyway, I'm saying all this in the hopes that hearing from someone who made it to the other side can help you believe that you're not doomed to feel this way forever. (Also in the hopes that you're actually still reading this--sorry I'm a bit late to discover this sub and see your post.)

Me and that ER doc still chat, she checks in with me and asks how my treatment is, some (most) doctors are lazy and tired and just want the quickest and easiest solution and then get you outta there. It’s a fucked up system and has killed a lot of my family members because of the negligence. Wishing you well OP, it’s a tough battle and a long one but it’s always worth the fight.I still dream that I’m lying in that hospital bed slowing losing my breath as I die.

362,LaurenFantastic,"Wall of text incoming: I was diagnosed with cervical cancer a month before my wedding at the age of 31 (2021). Having a wedding and cancer treatment during the height of Covid was ALOT - mentally, emotionally and obviously physically. It completely turned all of my husband and I’s life plans upsidown (ex. Starting a family, looking at homes, etc). I entered menopause at 32. I went to counseling, as did my husband and I can’t stress the importance of it enough. I ended up in the mindset of “so what’s the point now” and knowing that you had the possibility of it resulting in a more grave outcome if not caught. I was the youngest patient in the transfusion suite by far and I dealt a lot with survivor’s guilt. 3 years later and I’m happy to say I’m still on NED status (no evidence of disease) - although my body has definitely take a toll due to the lack of hormones (I’m the heaviest I have ever been and getting the weight off feels near impossible, unless I were able to commit to OMAD and the gym every other day). It gets better. I won’t say that I don’t struggle mentally with where I am now, but that voice of “what if the cancer is back” is a lot more like a whisper, when it does decide to show up (usually around times when I have my biyearly exams or if something health related seems out of the norm). I changed my outlook of feeling guilty about taking personal time from work or doing things for me or that I want to do.

You're going to be in the chair for 6+ hours the first day so you can sleep in there. You may want a driver your first time, but you don't need one. For me-the steroid they give you to combat diarrhea may make you hyper for the first day and a half, then when you go to get your pump removed (46 hours later)you will begin to be very sick. It will last about 2.5-3 days, then you will feel better and better until it's time for chemo again. Please let them know if you are unable to get out of bed except for using the restroom. They are not sure how much of a dose you need so they give you the max for your weight. You can and should request they lower it if you just can't handle being that sick. They don't know what the exact amount of chemo will help you. Sorry, I've never been a good writer, but we have the same stage 4 colon cancer. Most likely it has spread somewhere which is why it's stage 4? I had Fluorourcil also. They paired mine with Oxilaplatin (sp?).

375,Limp_Falcon_2314,"Seizures and becoming very out of breath when walking a block or two. When I went to the hospital I was told I had a tumor in my right lung that was almost cutting off the lung from being functional and that I had severe pneumonia in that lung with it being nearly 50% full of fluid. No wonder I couldn’t breathe. MRI showed multiple brain tumors and my other scan showed bone cancer in the spine and hip. That was a little over a year ago that I was diagnosed and given a very short prognosis. Happy to report they were wrong on the prognosis and today I am NED after two brain surgeries, whole brain radiation and radiation on my hip, as well as a targeted medication for my specific mutation (ALK+ mNSCLC).Yep. Diagnosed mNSCLC in June, 2023. The tumors in my lung had metastasized to the bone (hip and spine) and brain. The biggest tumor in my lung was close to cutting off my lung from my ability to use it and as a result I had severe pneumonia too, with my lung nearly 50% full of fluid. I had to do emergency brain surgery and then shortly after do another brain surgery to install a shunt. A few weeks after I had healed from that I got whole brain radiation and radiation on my hip bone. Then they discovered a mutation in my cancer (ALK+) that allowed me to be put on a drug called Alecensa. June this year I was declared NED. My prognosis changed so much. They thought I wouldn’t make it two days at first and called in my family to get on flights immediately. Then they said 6 weeks - it changed over and over again. Here I am a year later with no evidence of disease.I’m not trying to hijack this post but I just wanted to say thank you for your comment, Popsicles. I’m two months out from being declared NED and my family acts like I should pretty much get over having fought cancer for a year because I’m NED. They’re pushing me to do stuff I do not feel ready to do, and tbh being quite mean spirited about it. They essentially think I’m being lazy, even though it has only been two months. My sister and mom trash talk me all the time about moving on and “what I need to be doing.” Thankfully I don’t live with any of them, but it is a constant text and phone call issue amongst the entire family, and also with me. Also, thank you to u/CorporateNonPerson for their comment. That was the first time I’ve ever heard someone else talk about the body betrayal feelings. I feel that very deeply - and was just trying to explain that to my dad the other day. It feels good to know that I’m not alone.

Went through the radiation, chemo, and internal radiation (barbaric, actually). I don't think the tumor ever died but doctors kept telling me MRI was just picking up necrotic tissue. This was in 2019. In 2023 I was getting very short of breath. I told my oncologist about that and he said, there's no way it's cancer spread but if I feel better, I can go down and get an X-ray. Results came in, tumor pushing on lung, now collapsed lung. Also paralyzed my vocal chords because the phrenic nerve was being pressed for too long. Now I'm stage 4B because the cervical cancer metastasized. Went through a gruelling year of treatments that only kept the tumor stable. Now just on immunotherapy and targeted therapy, which is also giving bad side effects. Doctors are very quick to dismiss patients.

416,McDrewlius,"Yeah, I can see it going either way with the celebrating, especially what day is picked to commemorate. Personally i’ve been reflective and full of gratitude this week (Wednesday was a year from diagnosis), but I think when the ‘last med taken’ anniversary rolls around, I might try to get the gang together and have a barbecue and maybe blow out a candle.Either way, love your “celebrate anything and everything” vibe, you right! We been thru it, time for some good times :)Lol would be kind of a downer at Christmas I suppose. It’ll probably become less of a thing for me 20 years out as well, but this year had me thinking. Thank you for sharing!I didn’t get a cool bell ringing thing either, was actually a little let down leaving the dr office that day! I remember wanting to hug a bunch of people there then realized that might be crossing a line lol so I just thanked them and headed on home. Seemed pretty anti-climatic. I definitely had some heavy emotions when I got home after that, and really for a while whenever I’d be alone it’d dominate my thoughts. Phew! So yeah. Thank you for sharing.That’s totally understandable, cancer is scary enough as it is, no need to tempt fate, I get it. Hopefully in time it gets a little easier. My one year from diagnosis date is Aug 28, and i’ve been in a strange headspace all week thinking about what I was going through.I like the idea of acknowledging and being grateful of all the milestones- someone on here said thinking about how far they have come through adversity- and celebrating the “end of treatments” day. My “home from hospital after 10 straight weeks” day is the day before Thanksgiving and I’m sure we’ll have a toast that night.I hope come February there’s a store sorely lacking in their shatter-able plate selection! Lungleavin’ day deserves a celebration!! Love the idea of shattering fears and plates, awesome.I’m in my last couple weeks of treatment from APL. 42 year old male, in Glendale CA. It has sucked, but I guess it always could have been worse.Got diagnosed late last August 2023 after a blood pressure test was 181/something which led me to my Dr ordering blood tests, to find my blood levels basically zeroed out. Started blood transfusions immediately, had 1st bone marrow biopsy, week later confirmed diagnosis, had a port put in within a week of that, which gave me a massive hematoma around my chest and neck (on account of the zero platelets) that took about 2 weeks to get down to where they could try to access it. I went from feeling no symptoms the first week to barely being able to make it to the toilet after a few days once it hit.When they had trouble accessing the port (after several days of both blood transfusions and platelets) I was admitted to the hospital. I’m in Glendale, CA, and the LA Cancer Network is in the Glendale Adventist Hospital. My first stay was 5 weeks. I was getting blood and platelets every other day like clockwork, and after a couple days it overwhelmed the staff I guess and they shipped me to ICU. I had begun ATRA and it infiltrated my lungs and I was really struggling to breathe and was put on a max flow breather (the thing in the nostrils, but this was about as thick as a snorkel). I was so bruisey that my whole right arm turned purple from the blood pressure checks. At some point my port stopped working and they decided to try an “adjustment” which was brutally painful- think the surgeon cutting me open and manhandling around the port to try to “unkink” it. Felt like Andre the Giant was playing a Ouija board on my chest. I blew 3 blood vessels in my eyes from the strain from that. That was not fun. In ICU, Had my only week long round of chemo (Idarubacin) that I surprisingly handled okay, more and more blood bags and platelets… after about 2 weeks my white blood cell count started coming down (it had skyrocketed with the ATRA) and my lungs kinda settled and I left ICU. Started the standard 5 atra pills in morning/5 at night along with the mon-friday arsenic IV’s. Seemed to be stabilizing. Had my 2nd Bone Marrow Biopsy to see if I was in remission. Dr’s were optimistic, was discharged after 5 weeks.Was home for a day, Dr got my results (in remission! Yay) told me to go home and enjoy a week off from treatment (it’s about mid October now). Next day I feel awful, have a 104 degree fever, borderline convulsing from the chills annnnnnd back to the ER. Made it 2 days in public. Super depressing. Takes about a week of antibiotics (Vankomyacyin) before they decide my port is the culprit for my sickness, so they remove it. Then I don’t get better, still feverish all the time (this is about 2 weeks into the second stay) and my lungs and chest cavity start filling with infection/fluid. I get a tube put into my lung, and I have an abscess on my liver that’s driving the infection, and a tube gets put into that too. 2 tubes coming out my right ribs draining pink snot for over 2 weeks, infection goes down. Haven’t been getting any treatment for the cancer the whole second stint in the hospital. After 2 weeks of the tubes im my ribs (worst stint of the whole saga, but I did get introduced to morphine here) i get them removed. I get 2nd port put in the day before i’m discharged, the day before Thanksgiving. 10 weeks and 3 days of hospitalization total. Generally speaking it’s been standard treatment after that. 4 cycles of 1 month on, one month off of mon-friday arsenic infusions, and 7 cycles of 2 weeks on 2 weeks off of ATRA. I have found the ATRA to be far more of a grind than the arsenic- gives me headaches, i sleep awful, and just feel kinda feverish the majority of the time.I have one more week of Arsenic infusions and ATRA, then two weeks off, then 2 more weeks of ATRA, and i’m DONE.Haven’t ever typed everything out like this before, and…good lord it’s a novel.",651,0,0,"['start', 'yeah', 'i', 'see', 'going',

419,Melwaukee17,"Hey! Welcome to the really awful club. I don’t live in the same state as my mom, and I’ve been flying in for every round of chemo (every three weeks). She’s on the same combo as your dad will be. My Dad is home with my Mom, so I can’t speak fully to the him being alone preparedness, but I even want to get my mom a life alert thing or something to wear for if she’s down and no one notices quick enough. The biggest side effect for these combo of meds so far is sleepiness. The 24 hours post infusion your dad will have some energy because they infuse a steroid with the chemo, so there’s a little energy boost there. Then come Sunday/Monday he’ll be overwhelmingly sleepy. My mom is not a ~sleepy~ person and these meds have been knocking her out for days post chemo. My biggest help has been doing things around the house for her while she’s sleeping. Appetite is also suppressed, so try to find something that your dad will eat no matter what. You also have to give a pretty direct pep talk to your dad of “if you want a chance to fight this, you HAVE to eat. You can’t lose weight.” My mom needed this pep talk because as a woman she always celebrated losing weight. But now it’s an extremely bad thing. My last anecdote, is odds are you’re going to meet with the oncologist before the infusions just for discussions and updates. Idk if either of you guys are medical, but please look into as much as you can and make a list of any pertinent questions you want to ask the doctor. My mom leaves every single aspect of her care up to me, so if I don’t “know” whah the doctor is saying we’re all screwed, so I go into every appointment at the ready with every single bit of knowledge I can muster. It’s a depressing reality to face, but the US healthcare system isn’t set up so that most patients are ~cared~ about or ~advocated~ for. So you really have to fight for attention and answers. It’s rough. Good luck to you guys on the start of it all. there’s a lot of guilt that goes into being a not nearby child and I’m right there with you. My therapist helps me talk it out weekly lol. Keep the hope going for your dad because at the end that’s all we got.You’re so right. We’re “excited” to finally be doing something since the cancer was caught so tragically late. So doing something feels better than nothing. I will definitely be her eyes and years. And you’re right, figuring out who to call and when is half the battle. Learning that the healthcare system is beyond not a smooth oiled machine is, adding to the compounded stress.Thank you! Went as well as it could. We have the day one steroid energy right now, so hoping the crash isn’t too hard. She’s drinking plenty!Thank you for the insight. From all my reading it seems completely 50/50 on whether Keytruda is a ‘miracle’ or extremely detrimental. Hoping my mom gets the lucky half. Keeping your mom in my thoughts also.

424,MindlessParsley1446,"Thank you for sharing this. I'm so happy to hear the encouraging update on your mom ❤️❤️❤️May I ask why you don't have an oncologist? I'm really sorry to hear of your struggles. I've had many myself. I found that utilizing my anger energy towards doing some of the crappy stuff like dealing with thousands of dollars in insurance claims helped me through it - I felt like it was something within my control at least..I had no symptoms whatsoever. Stage IV lung cancer (ROS1+ Non-Small Cell)Hi, there and sorry to hear about your husband. I had an upper lobectomy last August. The recovery for me was definitely tolerable with pain medication. I was able to walk just fine, and did so as soon as the weather cooperated (midwesterner here, and weather can be all over the place!). I walked regularly to help improve lung capacity and strength. Sleeping was a challenge, though. I ended up purchasing a wedge pillow set (convertible for various angles and an under-the-knee pillow for support and comfort). I had to sleep sitting straight up for about a month (maybe more, can't remember now!). I also got a neck pillow to support my neck during sleep. I experienced what I call ""zingers"" where the incisions were, so was prescribed Gabapentin to help with that. I had the Robotic-assisted surgery, so about 5 small incisions. Since the opioids blocked me up, I made sure to take stool softener and also powdered Miralax to help keep things moving. Best of luck ❤️YES! 2nd leading cause is Radon!Fantastic news!! Congratulations 😊❤️When I went through chemo once/week via IV infusions of Carbo/Taxol, I made sure to drink plenty of water in order to help prep my veins for the IV as well as to help flush out my system. I brought and iPod with earbuds so I could listen to music. I went alone each time, and didn't want to hear any other noise from my surroundings there (peace of mind, I suppose). They did provide me blankets and snacks, which was so nice.

441,NP_huh,"My fiancé and his mother sent stinker emails to all of them. The fact that his mother and one of the ENT docs were acquaintances was a coincidence. So no one we know will visit them ever again. They were just very apologetic and offering discounts. And were trying to get more involved post diagnosis. Which made me even angrier.I hope you’re doing better now. It’s frustrating but I’m glad you’re getting the treatment you deserve.What bugs me is that the doctors I visited could have atleast guided me to the correct department if they didn’t know how to help me. It’s sad but when I finally was taken seriously and was in the MRI machine, I was hoping they would find something off with me, just so I could prove the previous doctors wrong.Unfortunately, yes. I was dismissed even with the symptoms. I was prescribed basic painkillers and told to take it easy. Until one day when I couldn’t bear the pain anymore and had to rush to the ER.I’m so sorry you had to go through this. I hope you’re getting the correct course of treatment now. Sending good luck!Yes. My report states it as metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma. My oncologists have been referring to it as RCC.Very sorry to hear what you went through. Good luck to you too. Hope we come out stronger on the other side of this.Hello there fellow 31/F with brain mets. I’m on the same boat, RCC mets in many places, 2 in my brain. I underwent proton therapy for the same, and immunotherapy (keytruda) every 3 weeks with Cabo everyday. There has been significant reduction. I have to get MRIs every 3 months. And I’m very hopeful for the next one. I know overall it sucks. My lifestyle has changed a lot. I do not feel like the same person I used to be pre diagnosis. But hope keeps me going. Stay strong out there!!Stay strong! I know it’s easier said than done. I’m 31 with metastatic RCC (this pest is everywhere). Got diagnosed in April. Have gone through radiation and my immunotherapy cycles every 3 weeks. Lots of side effects but body is responding well (slowly but surely). And I totally understand what you feel. It’s very different when you’re the patient. Mainstream media portrays cancer like the endgame. But medicine has advanced so much. And if you have a good support system and people rooting for you, you are so so lucky. It sucks, no doubt. I’m not the same person anymore. I had a very active lifestyle, I used to power lift, I still have my job but I’m on a sabbatical. I loved going for dinners. But the disease has changed me. It’s the energy levels and side effects from the treatments. Was on corticosteroids that made me gain a lot of weight. But I dunno, maybe I’m delusional sometimes, but I see myself getting back to my old life slowly. Really slowly, but surely.

They placed an order in my chart to serve me my food in white Styrofoam containers after that and I did fine.When I had my worst cancer experience my oncologist refused even discussed the odds of survival. He told me that whatever those odds are, there are people who survived and people who don’t, so it’s up to you to survive, and the odds are irrelevant. We all worry about the odds, but really that’s the truth.It’s not the positive thought that is beneficial. It’s the lack of chronic stress and anxiety which weakens the immune system. When the immune system is too weak, it allows cancer to spread as opposed to killing off the cells. There is a great deal of evidence on this bread for many years. Also, it makes sense.Back at you friend. It’s all true. It’s all good.Good point. I was thinking that it is consoling to talk to other people about the same problem that you have, but it didn’t come across so well. The more I learn about cancer, the less afraid I am. I will always remember when I was given my diagnosis in the doctor’s office. It was totally devastating. Wanted to surgically remove body parts immediately and did not know about some of the more advanced treatments.Psychoimmunology, or psychoneuroimmunology, studies the interactions between the mind, nervous system, and immune system, particularly how stress impacts immune function and cancer progression. Chronic stress is linked to immune dysregulation, which can exacerbate inflammation and impair the immune system’s ability to fight cancer effectively. Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system, leading to hormonal changes that promote tumor growth and metastasis. Stress management strategies, including psychological and pharmacological interventions, are being explored to mitigate these effects and improve cancer outcomes.

After 9 months after the transplant i felt normal again, now i enjoy every day, going on vacation a lot and spent as much time with my family as i can (before cancer it worked 50 jours a week) I am 4 years clean now.I had non hodgkin stage 4 the worst side effects were nausia and problems with eating, i live in Belgium next to the border in Holland, so Weed was easy to get, i did help a lot with my nausia, and my eating problem, food tasted better, it also helpt with my sleep problem, so for me it was very benificial, you dont have to smoke like 3 or 4 joint, a few puffs now and then can surely help. Hope this helpsEverything off Bob Marley 😎 especially 3 little birds. https://youtu.be/HNBCVM4KbUM?si=04-uucMg4T_MovLvI had cancer (Non hodgkin stage 4) when i was 34, i have a wife and a beautiful daughter who was 6 at the time, i had a stemcell transplant because it was a agressieve cancer, beating cancer was the hardest thing i ever did, after my stemcell treatment however it took me about a year to get back to the person i was before the cancer, lots off Ups and downs, also with my wife whose very emotional type. My tip is to take one day at the time, dont look at the future, and try to spent As much time with your family, take care of yourself, eat healty, and keep your mind busy, go for a walk, or on a vacation if you feel better, try Meditation. And keep in contact with your loved ones.

473,OffMyRocker2016,"I'm so sorry to hear of your diagnosis. You should also post this into r/breastcancer too for even more direct support. . Take care in the meantime, OP. 🌻Not for me. I've tried it when I was initially at stage IIIB (with 100% PDL expression) and I failed on it right away, after the first 3 month cycle, unfortunately. Then I tried Keytruda next and I failed miserably on that immunotherapy, too, sadly. It was devastating for me because I was so hopeful with having such a high PDL expression, but it just didn't work out for me. People with 50% or higher PDL expression typically can do very well with immunotherapy treatment. Now, I'm very happy to report that, although I'm stage IV, for 2.5 years now (cross myself lol), I'm back on chemo that was one of my first line treatments 3.7 years ago, Taxol (paclitaxel), and so far I'm doing pretty well on it. Just had my first 3 month scans after starting back on it and I'm currently stable/shrinking my liver mets, thankfully. I'm hoping to stay on this for at least another 3-9 months or more if im super lucky.. fingers crossed. Everyone is different though and many factors are involved in treatment success or failure along the process. Late stage cancer is a bitch. Constantly switching treatments is just part of the Whack-a-Mole game we have to play in these later stages of our cancer life, unfortunately. It's kind of like chasing your tail in a way. Lol But you just do your best to get through it, one scan at a time, with lots of hope for good results in each one. 🌻Oh..I forgot to mention that I had the similar treatment plan and know his throat pain well. Had 30 sessions of radiation to my primary in the right lower lobe and my medistinal lymph nodes (center of chest) and it was beyond awful. At the same time, I was on Carbo/Taxol for 6 weeks at that time. It's going to take some time, like a couple of months after completion, for his soreness to improve, imo. That burn is something else and I'll never forget it. Ugh. I had hydrocodone oral syrup to use/take 30 minutes before eating and that was a lifesaver on top of the extended release morphine tablets and lidocaine oral solution as well to drink.

I am fortunate to live in Delaware, and I'm close to Philly, so I was able to get a 2nd opinion at the university of Pennsylvania. not all doctors and hospitals are created equal. if those chicks make you happy, keep them! if you are worried about what might happen if you're not here, talk to a local animal shelter and see if they can help in the event the worst happens.I'm 46 and male.

507,PartisansArmes,"Sadly, there is a serious problem in medicine for women as they are often not treated with the necessary care and dilgence. This extends well beyond cancer. The best thing is to be a staunch advocate for your care and do not be afraid to speak up. The key like anything is to be respestful but firm. As ridiculous as this may sound, if you can bring a guy with you who will help with asking questions and advocating for you then absolutely do it. As a cancer patient, the last thing you should should be dealing is sexism. However unlike when we are healthy, the energy isn't there to deal with it and the bottomline is that you need the best care possible without having to wonder if your symptoms are being ignored and minimized.Marijuana edibles can help a lot with nausea. I'v also found that ginger candies, aloe vera drinks along with coconut water, and carrot juice seem to help me a lot when I don't feel well.People say it because they don't have anything else to say. It's more of someone being unsure how to process so people speak in cliches when that happens. The problem for everyone is the question of how much trauma/pain can someone handle and is fighting becoming so exahustive that the person's quality of live is terrible. What I will say is that being in a study could help him and it could also help others and that might be the biggest thing out of all of this. Everyone of us are part of record to help others who may face the same things we are facing. Certainly we'd like to be the miracle story, but if we can't but we can help someone else I'd say that is worth a whole lot.The key thing about care is to always ask the patient (your mom) how they feel about the care and whether or not they feel there is a problem with the quality of care. Typing the cancer does take time (2-3 weeks) and it is critical because it gives the oncologist an idea of the treatment they will use to fight the cancer. While it's difficult, I strongly recommend shying away from looking at percetnages/survival rates etc as treatment has changed significantly in the last few years and the rates that you will find on the internet aren't typically filtered for age and they often are from 5+ years ago.. The reality is that the only things your mom can control are her diet and exercise. Everything else is out of her control.",219,0,0,"['start', 'sadly', 'serious', 'problem', 'medicine', 'women', 'often', 'treated', 'necessary', 'care', 'dilgence', 'this', 'extends', 'well', 'beyond', 'cancer', 'the', 'best', 'thing', 'staunch', 'advocate', 'care', 'afraid', 'speak', 'the', 'key', 'like', 'anything', 'respestful', 'firm', 'as', 'ridiculous', 'may', 'sound', 'bring', 'guy', 'help', 'asking', 'questions', 'advocating', 'absolutely', 'as', 'cancer', 'patient', 'last', 'thing', 'dealing', 'sexism', 'however', 'unlike', 'healthy', 'energy', 'isnt', 'deal', 'bottomline', 'need', 'best', 'care', 'possible', 'without', 'wonder', 'symptoms', 'ignored', 'minimizedmarijuana', 'edibles', 'help', 'lot', 'nausea', 'iv', 'also', 'found', 'ginger', 'candies', 'aloe', 'vera', 'drinks', 'along', 'coconut', 'water', 'carrot', 'juice', 'seem', 'help', 'lot', 'i', 'dont', 'feel', 'wellpeople', 'say', 'dont', 'anything', 'else', 'say', 'its', 'someone', 'unsure', 'process', 'people', 'speak', 'cliches', 'happens', 'the', 'problem', 'everyone', 'question', 'much', 'traumapain', 'someone', 'handle', 'fighting', 'becoming', 'exahustive', 'persons', 'quality', 'live', 'terrible', 'what', 'i', 'say', 'study', 'could', 'help', 'could', 'also', 'help', 'others', 'might', 'biggest', 'thing', 'everyone', 'us', 'part', 'record', 'help', 'others', 'may', 'face', 'things', 'facing', 'certainly', 'wed', 'like', 'miracle', 'story', 'cant', 'help', 'someone', 'else', 'id', 'say', 'worth', 'whole', 'lotthe', 'key', 'thing', 'care', 'always', 'ask', 'patient', 'mom', 'feel', 'care', 'whether', 'feel', 'problem', 'quality', 'care', 'typing', 'cancer', 'take', 'time', '23', 'weeks', 'critical', 'gives', 'oncologist', 'idea', 'treatment', 'use', 'fight', 'cancer', 'while', 'difficult', 'i', 'strongly', 'recommend', 'shying', 'away', 'looking', 'percetnagessurvival', 'rates', 'etc', 'treatment', 'changed', 'significantly', 'last', 'years', 'rates', 'find', 'internet', 'arent', 'typically', 'filtered', 'age', 'often', '5', 'years', 'ago', 'the', 'reality', 'things', 'mom', 'control', 'diet', 'exercise', 'everything', 'else', 'control', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,เพศชาย,เล่าประสบการณ์คนอื่น,non,['No symptoms identified'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,['Unable to specify'],Unable to specify
508,Party_Author_9337,"So most young non smoker with lung cancer have a targetable dna mutation. I did not. But most do. And if they do, there is a good chance that they can be treated with specific medications. I think it took about a month for my bio markers to come back. It was a long wait.I am sorry about your teenage lung cancer. That should never happen. It’s just not fair. I was 38 when I was diagnosed, which is still young for lung cancer but not pediatric. Ask your oncologist to talk to a social worker. They can get you in touch with support groups. I found a lot of comfort in this group. There are a few other women I have met via TikTok who are also in their 30s with lung cancerI ate pretzels and watermelon the week after chemo. It causes a really bad taste in my mouth. So I didn’t have much of an appetiteI was 39 when I did my chemo for lung cancer. It wiped me out days 3-6 I would take multiple naps a day. I would purchase a urinal from Amazon incase the fatigue from chemo makes it hard for your dad to get to the bathroom. Also, have his doctors prescribed a Walker? Or maybe useful if you have to take him back to the office the first week post chemo. Has he tried sleeping with a wedge pillow? Google pills for acid reflex. That might help keep him upright but let him stretch out in bed. I am glad he is drinking water now. Chemo can change your taste buds for a week or two. So water may taste bad. Buy some flavored water packets. Don’t stock up on anything pre chemo. I also lived alone and I bought what I thought I would want to eat if I had the stomach but. But my taste was so off, I didn’t want any of it. Made me hate the taste of the yellow gatoraid. Which was my favorite. I was able to drink the blue flavor, which I normally don’t like. If he is already really bad at eating, you might want to look into continuous glucose monitor. See if he would wear it. That way you can see if his sugar is going too low from not eatingAsk about pain medication for home use after the surgery. My surgeon refused to treat pain with opioids. After two to three weeks of unbearable pain, my friend suggested I reach out to my oncologist. She had no issue treating my pain. Use the incentive spirometer. And walk. Sleeping can be uncomfortable. Make sure you have a few comfy pillows in different sizes to help find a position of comfortI was 38 when I was diagnosed, non smoker. I wish I could blame it on stress. But we don’t know why it’s more commonI had a lobectomy for my lung cancer. I was never offered radiation. I am glad the tumor was removed. I also had like 20 lymph nodes removed and biopsied.The chemo days will have you at the infusion center almost all day. Be prepared to hurry up and wait. Usually the access the port and draw labs. Wait for the lab results. Then wait for in the drugs to be prepared. My oncologist would hydrate me with a bag of IV fluids and nausea medication before the chemo started. My first round was probably the easiest with the fatigue. But the hardest for nausea. It hit about day 3 or 4. I only ate watermelon and pretzels. After the first round we found out what nausea meds worked. By day seven I felt better.",372,0,0,"['start', 'so', 'young', 'non', 'smoker', 'lung', 'cancer', 'targetable', 'dna', 'mutation', 'i', 'but', 'and', 'good', 'chance', 'treated', 'specific', 'medications', 'i', 'think', 'took', 'month', 'bio', 'markers', 'come', 'back', 'it', 'long', 'waiti', 'sorry', 'teenage', 'lung', 'cancer', 'that', 'never', 'happen', 'it', '’', 'fair', 'i', '38', 'i', 'diagnosed', 'still', 'young', 'lung', 'cancer', 'pediatric', 'ask', 'oncologist', 'talk', 'social', 'worker', 'they', 'get', 'touch', 'support', 'groups', 'i', 'found', 'lot', 'comfort', 'group', 'there', 'women', 'i', 'met', 'via', 'tiktok', 'also', '30s', 'lung', 'canceri', 'ate', 'pretzels', 'watermelon', 'week', 'chemo', 'it', 'causes', 'really', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'so', 'i', '’', 'much', 'appetitei', '39', 'i', 'chemo', 'lung', 'cancer', 'it', 'wiped', 'days', '36', 'i', 'would', 'take', 'multiple', 'naps', 'day', 'i', 'would', 'purchase', 'urinal', 'amazon', 'incase', 'fatigue', 'chemo', 'makes', 'hard', 'dad', 'get', 'bathroom', 'also', 'doctors', 'prescribed', 'walker', 'or', 'maybe', 'useful', 'take', 'back', 'office', 'first', 'week', 'post', 'chemo', 'has', 'tried', 'sleeping', 'wedge', 'pillow', 'google', 'pills', 'acid', 'reflex', 'that', 'might', 'help', 'keep', 'upright', 'let', 'stretch', 'bed', 'i', 'glad', 'drinking', 'water', 'chemo', 'change', 'taste', 'buds', 'week', 'two', 'so', 'water', 'may', 'taste', 'bad', 'buy', 'flavored', 'water', 'packets', 'don', '’', 'stock', 'anything', 'pre', 'chemo', 'i', 'also', 'lived', 'alone', 'i', 'bought', 'i', 'thought', 'i', 'would', 'want', 'eat', 'i', 'stomach', 'but', 'taste', 'i', '’', 'want', 'made', 'hate', 'taste', 'yellow', 'gatoraid', 'which', 'favorite', 'i', 'able', 'drink', 'blue', 'flavor', 'i', 'normally', '’', 'like', 'if', 'already', 'really', 'bad', 'eating', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'continuous', 'glucose', 'monitor', 'see', 'would', 'wear', 'that', 'way', 'see', 'sugar', 'going', 'low', 'eatingask', 'pain', 'medication', 'home', 'use', 'surgery', 'my', 'surgeon', 'refused', 'treat', 'pain', 'opioids', 'after', 'two', 'three', 'weeks', 'unbearable', 'pain', 'friend', 'suggested', 'i', 'reach', 'oncologist', 'she', 'issue', 'treating', 'pain', 'use', 'incentive', 'spirometer', 'and', 'walk', 'sleeping', 'uncomfortable', 'make', 'sure', 'comfy', 'pillows', 'different', 'sizes', 'help', 'find', 'position', 'comforti', '38', 'i', 'diagnosed', 'non', 'smoker', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'could', 'blame', 'stress', 'but', '’', 'know', '’', 'commoni', 'lobectomy', 'lung', 'cancer', 'i', 'never', 'offered', 'radiation', 'i', 'glad', 'tumor', 'removed', 'i', 'also', 'like', '20', 'lymph', 'nodes', 'removed', 'biopsiedthe', 'chemo', 'days', 'infusion', 'center', 'almost', 'day', 'be', 'prepared', 'hurry', 'wait', 'usually', 'access', 'port', 'draw', 'labs', 'wait', 'lab', 'results', 'then', 'wait', 'drugs', 'prepared', 'my', 'oncologist', 'would', 'hydrate', 'bag', 'iv', 'fluids', 'nausea', 'medication', 'chemo', 'started', 'my', 'first', 'round', 'probably', 'easiest', 'fatigue', 'but', 'hardest', 'nausea', 'it', 'hit', 'day', '3', '4', 'i', 'ate', 'watermelon', 'pretzels', 'after', 'first', 'round', 'found', 'nausea', 'meds', 'worked', 'by', 'day', 'seven', 'i', 'felt', 'better', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,"['fatigue', 'pain']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Chemotherapy', 'Radiation Therapy']",carcinoma

I am so so sorry 💔💔💔💔💔I also came into contact with two other 18 year olds with ALK in the last few weeks. I don’t know why this is happening 😭Hi I’m so so sorry :( please consider checking out our young lung cancer Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/share/B5kWLi4EZ35RjCPb/?mibextid=K35XfP & check out YLCI.org as we are a new organization here to support younger people with lung cancer. 18 this is so unfair 😭So sorry about your partner. Just for people reading this .. most mutations in lung cancer are not inherited but are somatic mutations (meaning damage that occurs throughout one’s life time).. not passed on. They are trying to figure out if there are any other genetics that predispose people without risk factors to lung cancer but mutations such as EGFR ALK RET aren’t typically inherited .. genomic mutations vs geneticLung cancer in never smokers is on the rise they don’t really know whyThis recent webinar does a nice job explaining it:https://gkc.go2.org/pages/inherit-studyIf she has a targetable mutation like EGFR .. and gets on right treatment she could start to feel so much better within days 🤍Wow amazing !

512,PetalumaDr,"Not sure if discussing what your fears are with those who love you and know you best would help or not. I doubt it would hurt. I'm not sure if the fear is surgical complication, death, losing a part of who you are with a gender specific body part, loss of control when out,... All are valid fears and some can be addressed by your care team and some by friends and family. It often turns out that cognitive work around say a risk of dying from surgery being 1/10,000 can help with that specific fear (that is less than the risk of dying by driving to the hospital). Good luck.Beautiful thoughts. Thanks for sharing. I might counter with the fact that most battles are not ones of our choosing, Ukraine, Gaza, Bhagavad Gita,... There are no winners in war, just relative degrees of loss. Cancer is but one manifestation of our simple mortal reality- we are born, we suffer, we die. Nothing particularly special about cancer in that regard other than it often puts us in the 80% of people who know their time on this plane is limited (as opposed to the 20% who just don't wake up some morning). I completely agree that it isn't about winning or losing ""the battle"" but whether one feels gratitude for the life they have had. The quality of a life is not measured in years but in connections. Sitting here with my terminal cancer that I will never ""beat"" I am amazed at the life I have had and can feel nothing but gratitude. I hope the same is true for you my friend.Clearly not a rash decision, and clearly your call. The only thought I have (which may already have occurred) is whether you have spoken to a Palliative Care doctor about your goals of care and making sure you have a smooth transition from chemo to just managing your symptoms for the best quality of life you can have in your remaining time. I seriously doubt any sane physician or informed loving parent would try to stop you after 7 years of chemo.I don' know the rules in England but you should have the right to speak with your Radiation Oncologist and get their expert opinion on whether you are done with radiation or not. Agree with pain specialist if Oncologist not adequately addressing the pain. Good luck.I'm sorry this is happening to you. I have no wisdom or pithy comments for you, just compassion for your circumstances. Good luck.I am a retired physician with cancer but not a psychiatrist so take everything I say with a large grain of salt. Roughly 13% of our population has a personality disorder and it is not uncommon that they partner with someone who also has a personality disorder. Their children often have difficult lives because of that. You mentioned narcissistic and it is possible that they have a narcissistic personality disorder. We now know from the work of Simon Baron Cohen and others that they have broken brains with failed neuro circuits as demonstrated on fMRI, which preclude them from feeling empathy- he calls it the ""empathy circuit"" (and yes he is Sasha Baron Cohen's or Borat's cousin). Perhaps neither of your parents would really be diagnosed with a personality disorder if evaluated but it isn't totally important to the point because the concept can help you with your pain and suffering and may free you a bit from this suffering. The most prevailing theory now is that people who have personality disorders have them because of childhood trauma, which causes them to create a dysfunctional way of walking through the world, in order to get by. So they are in a sense broken before they are old enough to have their own children or get a fMRI to confirm that they lack the empathy circuit the rest of us have. So you get to decide whether to sit in the sadness and hurt of what sounds like a very abnormal parental response to your cancer, or you can choose to see it through a lens of empathy and gratitude. To see the abused 5 year olds who didn't do anything to deserve having their brains remolded by childhood trauma, to be glad that you can feel empathy, and to be grateful that they were somehow able to raise you in an environment that allowed you to feel empathy despite not growing up in one themselves. Imagine how barren your life would be if you could not feel empathy. I could be way off base but this allows you a framework to see their actions as the best they could do given what they have been given to work with in their lives. I sincerely hope this helps provide some perspective.Excellent point. I was fortunate enough to be given an early appointment with a Palliative Care/Symptom Management doctor when I received my initial terminal diagnosis. It has allowed me a forum to discuss not only symptom management but goals of care. My understanding is that some areas of the country are understaffed with Palliative Care doctors, which may or may not be the case in your situation.I'm not sure that there is a way as a human being to be hit with this info and not feel overwhelmed. There will no doubt be many ups and downs. Few of us ""thought this would happen to us"". Your doctors, nurses, therapists, ... deal with overwhelmed people all day and the good ones will be life rafts for you as you feel yourself drowning in the uncertainty, mortality worries,... I would strongly suggest getting an Oncology Psychologist ASAP if one is available locally and you can fit it into your insurance/finances. They see overwhelmed people all day, every day and can help you navigate all of the uncertainty and worries that are both universal and unique to your situation. Good luck.Yes- very normal and you have already chosen the most functional response to this very common but overwhelming situation- to seek the counsel and wisdom of experts that comes from experience, which makes this situation ""normal"" in their work world. I was given a grim prognosis and rushed to get my affairs in order and to get a good second opinion. What you need is shepherding to help you come to the realization that most of us die and leave our families sooner than we want to, or have partners die and leave us sooner than we wanted them to (whether it is in your 20s or 80s). It almost seems like a shock to me in retrospect that most of us go through life without understanding that basic fact. The Stoics and many others tried to convey this to us through their teachings. I hope for you that it ends up being many many decades in the future. Good luck.Dunning Krueger textbook case. He is lucky you didn’t laugh at him. That would have really made him cry.

513,Pharm_Girl93,"Thank you so much for your response! One is 7mm, one is 9mm, and one is 15mm (1.5 cm). I know the two are considered small but close to that cutoff. Trying to be very positive. It just seems like bad surprise after bad surprise, especially when the original surgery was considered a success with full removal and good margins. Your message helped a lot though. I hope overall that you are doing well and hanging in there. I'm sending all the positive thoughts I can 💕My physician has not called me with the results and unfortunately may not until Tuesday due to the holiday weekend here. I do not have an oncology psychologist at this time. When I started this journey last year, everyone filled me with such hope and made it sound like it was going to be a year of hard work and then mostly smooth sailing. That's part of why I underwent the elective mastectomy, to reduce chances of ever dealing with it again. When, in fact, it's not even clear that I'll even be in remission or ""clear"" again.Thank you so much!I'm so sorry that you are going through this, but this gives me a lot of hope. This is my 4th chest surgery since mid April. I just keep telling myself that 1. There could be many other possibilities and 2. I know the primary tumor was gone between mid April and early June because we had to do several additional surgeries and the pathology for all was clean. It seems crazy to me (though I know not impossible) that the primary tumor grew for more than 4 months between being found and my diagnosis and didn't so much as touch a lymph node but in the span of a month? Maybe 2? It was able to regrow and cause multiple mets? I know this is just me convincing myself right now, but we gotta do what we gotta do to survive and there is nothing I can do without more information. I so appreciate you sharing! All of the comments have really made me see a little bit of reason and realize that I don't know much yet.I know better than to read them but it's so hard! Everyone was really sure they'd all come back negative and I was, foolishly, hoping for some positive news going into the long weekend 😅. That makes me feel much better. I am currently receiving Keytruda and have been since November, and I know one of my other chemos also carried a risk of lung impact. I'm telling myself that today, I am healthy and feel good. These nodules could have been there for months for all I know. So I'm going to keep on living my life until I'm told otherwise! I do not unfortunately but my husband has the day off and my best friend (who is an invasive ductal carcinoma survivor herself) is coming to spend the weekend with us. I just need to keep my head up ☺️ I appreciate your response so much though! I'm so glad your results were negative and hope you are doing well.Thank you for the advice! Unfortunately, I'm semi restricted due to being less than two weeks out from my mastectomy. However, I've been able to do little things 🥰 I recognized that morning major is going to change in 4ish days so I should do my best not to think about it. I'm thinking of you and your husband!I'm so glad to hear that these are stable for your loved one! This does make me feel better certainly.

518,PlateParking7647,"I just spoke to a friend yesterday about a new project looking for survivors sharing their stories of survival for the International Childhood Cancer Survivors’ Week. And she said the same thing. She didn't feel like a survivor because she ""only"" had a surgery to remove her tumour. My response is, there's no ""gotta be this high to ride the ride"". Someone else has always had it worse, but it doesn't diminish your own experience. As for the guilt, it's something I've experienced myself, especially when struggling mentally with suicidal thoughts in the past. No good advice on this one except saying that survival isn't easy, it's just the first step and those who did die, would they have lived, would probably have struggled same as we have. We always want more.Got sick 2003, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 15. Still have many of the issues since then, many similar to yours. I've attended many conferences for survivors and patient advocates and it's common in survivors attending to have similar issues. But, it's also shown in studies (finally getting more and more of these). Many factors will affect what late complications you may experience, age being one, but also treatment, sex and diagnosis. There's a plethora of studies showing this with some complications having higher risk when treatment was initiated at a lower age and some other at a higher one. This is a good summary though: https://www.cancer.gov/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-pdq I don't know your treatment schedule but I know ALL and non-Hodgkin's had a similar one. I got Asparaginase, Methotrexate (IV I believe), intrathecal and tablets, Vincristine. Probably more but I can't remember. Anyway, don't take my word this as I don't know your schedule.

526,PopsiclesForChickens,"Kind of. Like I feel like I could be well, but things keep pulling me down. Ended up my thyroid is messed up (no big deal, but hey, another pill). Just found out I have osteoporosis, right in the area where I got my radiation and I'm in my early 40s. That and I'm pretty sure my GI system will never be the same (colorectal cancer). I have to watch what I eat and a good day is probably 7-10 bowel movements. A bad day is many more. I make it work, but my goal during treatment was to get well enough to go on a backpacking trip next month with my daughter. I just had to cancel that because between the osteoporosis and the bowel movements, I just can't do it. I'll admit, I'm pretty depressed and angry about everything. Maybe it will get better, I'm 8 months into remission, but it feels like this is probably just my life now.That is definitely not everyone's experience. I was on FolFox (which includes 5FU) and could not have worked and was lucky enough to live in a state with paid short term disability. Although I guess it depends on your job and if you need to keep working.My family (parents and siblings) were completely unsupportive when I was sick. I'm trying to maintain a relationship with them, because of course now that I'm in remission, they all are around again and want to pretend nothing is wrong, but it's hard. It sucks. I had my spouse and one friend who were really there for me.The only good thing about any part of my cancer diagnosis and treatment was my husband. Married 17 years with 3 school age kids when I was diagnosed last year with stage 3 colorectal cancer. It was terrible, but he wasn't, he was and still is wonderful (I've been in remission since December). He let me cry to him after our kids were in bed almost every night last year, went with me to every doctor appointment he could, took time off after surgery to help me. And has been very patient and understanding with me as I've been pretty depressed and angry. We didn't have a lot of support. We see his family maybe once a year, my family decided me having cancer freaked them out too much to come around, and his best friends were unfortunately no help or support for him. I still feel bad that I had him and a couple of good friends, but he really had no one.I'm 8 months into remission and I still feel this way. Not just fear of a reoccurrence, but also depressed about the permanent side effects from all of the treatment. But people who haven't had cancer don't understand. They think it's like the flu. You got it treated, it's done, you ""beat"" cancer. So you put on a smile for them. I'm actually avoiding a lot of people these days. So I don't have a good answer, except to tell you I know how you feel.If it makes you feel better when I had a consult with a dietitian, they basically just said try it and if you don't tolerate it, don't eat/drink it. So helpful. /s OP, I don't think there's any set of rules. I can't eat red meat anymore. And I slowly added back in occasional carbonated drinks. But I've also just had to figure out how to live with my new system, which is 7-10 BMs on a good day.Diagnosed last year at 42 with stage 3 rectal cancer. Remission since December.

534,Previous_Basis8862,"My mum died 4 weeks after diagnosis of state 4 lung cancer. The rapid deterioration happened about a week after diagnosis when she contracted pneumonia. It was a massive shock to all of us but in many ways probably better for her than suffering through months of treatment that might only have prolonged her suffering. She had been very fit and healthy right up until 3 months before diagnosis and she kept getting the brush off from her doctors - they told her it was a chest infection, sinus infection, arthritis potentially. Eventually a rheumatologist sent her for scans and that’s when it was caught. I’m so sorry you are all going through this. I wish your mum a peaceful passing.I’m so sorry to hear this. My mum had what she and her doctors seemed to think were recurrent sinus and chest infections. She was on antibiotics on and off for 4 months. She started getting joint pain so was finally referred to a rheumatologist who thought she might have an autoimmune disorder and sent her for scans - lung cancer that had already spread to her bones. She was sent for a brain scan too as she was having excruciating headaches but we never got the results of that because unfortunately she passed away from (mainly) pneumonia just 4 weeks after that original scan. Immunotherapy was what the oncologists were talking about as her best chance though and it gave one of my friends and extra 15 months after she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer with brain and bone mets.

537,Proseccos,"I was diagnosed about a decade ago, but I do fit in the age range now. I am not one of those strong positive people that kicked cancer in the ass. I’ve long outlived my prognosis, through sheer luck alone, not at all through my efforts. I hid the diagnosis from everyone except my husband, who passed not long after. My friends found out eventually. Work never did. I was a full time STEM pre-med in college, starting a new full time job, and trying to deal with chemo all at once. It left me with near nil hours to sleep. I always prioritized school and work, and never finished a full course of chemo. I always gave up. I was very much a type-A gunner in school. Top of the class, good at almost everything on the first try (except baseball), athlete, a million hobbies, work hard to the bone, you can do anything you want-you make your dreams come true, Asian parents wet dream. I loved who I was, and I loved my life, because I started off in a completely different place and built it all from there. Cancer broke that lol. To this day, I haven’t come to terms with the fact that my brain is still writing checks that my body can’t cash. Chemo made me stupid. I am extraordinary no longer. I am no longer the best. I am no longer good at almost anything at the first try. I’ve lost my confidence to be honest. I now believe, there is quite a lot that I cannot do, not at least in the way I could before, and that brings a sense of melancholy. Before, failure was never failure. It was…exploration. It was that something required tweaking. Now failure sometimes hurts my ego and everything makes me self conscious about it being cancer related. It’s like I’ve aged backwards in maturity lol Things worked out okay in the end. I was “successful” still, in society’s terms. I retired early. But I do miss who I used to be. I think I would consider myself successful if I can build myself to the person I’d like to be. I think it’s unrealistic now to be extraordinary. I can’t bring my brain back. But I need to adjust now, to a more realistic new norm. And if I can achieve whatever I set, I think they’ll be contentment there. Externally, it’s all doable. In general, people don’t care in the dating life about the cancer in my experience. At work I always hid it, I had to adjust because it was competitive environment. But internally, a level of self awareness and acceptance is required. I was in denial, constantly waiting for things to pass and to get my brain and body back. And reality is, it’s not happening, for me.

549,Quick-Employment-229,"I'm also from India and I relate with what you have written here. I got my diagnosis over a month ago for a rare subtype of lymphoma and have been hit with a visceral sense of our privilege, our ability to afford this second chance at life. So many people in our country cannot afford it, it is surreal. I worry sometimes that if my cancer comes back, I may not have access to the new immunotherapy drugs and trials that people discuss here as further lines of treatment. But we are catching up in the bigger cities with the treatments. I am grateful that I have access to a relatively new chemo protocol. Wishing you luck in your journey.I dislike it when people ask how I'm feeling on the bad days. I know they genuinely care and want to know if I'm well, but it makes me angry anyway. How do you think I'm feeling, I have cancer. But I like it when they send me a meme or something, I don't feel like reporting on my illness always and I really hate the ""oh no what happened"" if I do tell them I'm hanging in there.

Like many others have said, sleeping and eating are the primary signs of death approaching. She will start to eat less and less, until she completely stops eating. With this, she will begin to sleep more and you might be unable to wake her up at times. During these phases you can apply some water to a piece of cloth and wet the inside of her mouth - since the mouth can become very dry. I highly recommend you to ask the hospice for support and advice, this will make it easier for you.

I had to take anti nausea medication a lot just to eat. It does get better though, things seem to return to normal (somewhat normal)once you have finished treatment.You can do the best you can with a positive attitude but you can’t adjust for the underlying stress that is every day life. Those are the stresses that can put cancer into over drive. My house burned down at the time I was given a Stage 4 diagnosis! I lost everything-there is no greater stress than losing your home. (It is actually listed as one of the most stressful things you can go through). This was also cancer number 5. I don’t know what really the answer is-people are different. It’s really like the stages of grief-no one can tell you what you are going to feel or go through. There is nothing more complicated than cancer. I just take it one day at a time!I think this is an individual issue-when you have survived five cancers and been in the “fight “ for 13 years like I have been it truly is a battle. I can’t even count anymore how many tests, appointments, blood draws, hospitalizations, that I have been through. When you start at a lesser stage and end up in the club nobody wants to be in-it triggers all kinds of feelings. I find that people don’t know what to say-if they say things like you mentioned I don’t take it to heart! It’s like when someone says “How are you”?in general (without cancer) I think do they really care how I am or are they just being polite? I don’t think people are trying to be disrespectful. It is a fight-it’s a fight for you life. It never ends when you have cancer! I don’t like the saying either about losing the fight-but that’s what’s ingrained in people! So cancer is as individual as we are. Our journey is our own. I would rather not take these things to heart but concentrate on making my day a little bit less about cancer and little bit more about life.Immunotherapy is not without side effects. Just because one person doesn’t have any doesn’t mean others don’t! I had a severe reaction to it that landed me in the hospital for a month, I almost died-so make your choice on what you believe is the best for you.

Keep sticky notes, pad of paper or a journal with you. Then make sure you do it every single time. Before bed, brain dump everything into a journal. Write until you can’t anymore. Then you write down 3-5 positive thoughts, goals or hopes. Then go to bed. Don’t do anything else. In the morning, re-read your positives & then write 1-2 more. Then go on with starting your day.

I spent a lot of time with friends and family. Just be nice to yourself. When you feel sad, let yourself feel sad. Time makes things easier.

573,SDamon83,"I just read this article about a man with lung cancer who they gave him months to live. It was metastatic lung cancer. he chose to get off treatment and he moved out of the US to Greece and drank red wine, ate healthy Greek food and worked in the vineyards. Since that diagnosis he is still alive 40+ years later. Miracles do happen. Follow your heart. Your higher self knows best. Everybody‘s cancer is unique and different. They’re alternative remedies, that you can take that that destroys cancer. As I said miracles do happen and I think a power greater than ourselves is in control. Spirituality is very important to me. I hate the Targeted therapy pills that I’m taking that have left me pretty much a homebody. I don’t work out anymore and I’m gaining so much weight. Currently, I’m suffering from acute inflammation where I have so much pain all over my body. Also these pharmaceuticals mess with brain chemistry so we have brain fog and we don’t think as sharply as we used to. I’ve had a little bit of chemotherapy and I hated the effect two days after when I felt like just killing myself. What chemotherapy does to the body is horrible. I think Western medicine sucks. And the science community as well. This day and age they should have something much better that can eradicate cancer. But chemotherapy and the targeted therapies are BIG money makers for big Pharma. My Oncologist stated that I have up to seven years to live. I laugh at that. How do they know?? They are not God.

As others have said on other posts (including mine) time is the most precious - you could maybe do day trips together or something I got my parents and I to do was fill out a favourite things questionnaire I made up and we've just been ticking different things off so, watching each other's favourite movies or cooking each other's favourite meals/having snacks etc!

614,Some_Girl_Au,"Sorry you are going through this. My dad passed away 3 days ago from the same cancer with mets to bone and lungs. He lived for 5 months post diagnosis. It was really frustrating that no one would give me the information on what to expect. There was just the shock when things started to happen. When things changed, they changed really quickly. The nurses explained the mottling of the skin, usually in the extremities (grey and spotty with some pooling of blood where there has been pressure, so underside of legs, back, etc). Extremities go cold when they are close to passing. Make sure they bring mouth spray, mouth sponge swabs, and lip balm as when they stop drinking, you need to keep their lips tongue and top of mouth moist. And also moist wipes to keep their eyes clean. My dad had burst where he would sit up screaming and then go back to sleep. He had a lot of trauma in his life, so his last days were terrifying for him and us. Towards the end, he forgot all our names, and we were all called Miss, but occasionally, he would recognise us and smile or give us kisses. He started choking on solid foods in the last week, so he moved to puree and thickened liquid, he stopped eating first a couple of days after starting puree and then eventually drinking, he did like icy poles which is how we were able to get some fluids into him in the last couple of days. His breathing got really shallow and laboured, and they had to give him a medication to help with the sputum in the back of his throat as he did choke at one point. He would also stop breathing for long periods of time (like sleep apnoea) 30 seconds at a time. His breathing just got shorter and shorter, but it wasn't laboured anymore. It was just little breaths that got smaller and smaller until he passed. We played his favourite music, held his hands, talked to him, re lived happy moments, and had jokes and laughs with him right up till the end.",206,0,0,"['start', 'sorry', 'going', 'my', 'dad', 'passed', 'away', '3', 'days', 'ago', 'cancer', 'mets', 'bone', 'lungs', 'he', 'lived', '5', 'months', 'post', 'diagnosis', 'it', 'really', 'frustrating', 'one', 'would', 'give', 'information', 'expect', 'there', 'shock', 'things', 'started', 'happen', 'when', 'things', 'changed', 'changed', 'really', 'quickly', 'the', 'nurses', 'explained', 'mottling', 'skin', 'usually', 'extremities', 'grey', 'spotty', 'pooling', 'blood', 'pressure', 'underside', 'legs', 'back', 'etc', 'extremities', 'go', 'cold', 'close', 'passing', 'make', 'sure', 'bring', 'mouth', 'spray', 'mouth', 'sponge', 'swabs', 'lip', 'balm', 'stop', 'drinking', 'need', 'keep', 'lips', 'tongue', 'top', 'mouth', 'moist', 'and', 'also', 'moist', 'wipes', 'keep', 'eyes', 'clean', 'my', 'dad', 'burst', 'would', 'sit', 'screaming', 'go', 'back', 'sleep', 'he', 'lot', 'trauma', 'life', 'last', 'days', 'terrifying', 'us', 'towards', 'end', 'forgot', 'names', 'called', 'miss', 'occasionally', 'would', 'recognise', 'us', 'smile', 'give', 'us', 'kisses', 'he', 'started', 'choking', 'solid', 'foods', 'last', 'week', 'moved', 'puree', 'thickened', 'liquid', 'stopped', 'eating', 'first', 'couple', 'days', 'starting', 'puree', 'eventually', 'drinking', 'like', 'icy', 'poles', 'able', 'get', 'fluids', 'last', 'couple', 'days', 'his', 'breathing', 'got', 'really', 'shallow', 'laboured', 'give', 'medication', 'help', 'sputum', 'back', 'throat', 'choke', 'one', 'point', 'he', 'would', 'also', 'stop', 'breathing', 'long', 'periods', 'time', 'like', 'sleep', 'apnoea', '30', 'seconds', 'time', 'his', 'breathing', 'got', 'shorter', 'shorter', 'wasnt', 'laboured', 'anymore', 'it', 'little', 'breaths', 'got', 'smaller', 'smaller', 'passed', 'we', 'played', 'favourite', 'music', 'held', 'hands', 'talked', 'lived', 'happy', 'moments', 'jokes', 'laughs', 'right', 'till', 'end', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,เพศชาย,เล่าประสบการณ์คนอื่น,non,['No symptoms identified'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,['Unable to specify'],Unable to specify

We are at Moores Cancer center and the treatment team loves him. They really take such good care of him. Plus a good attitude is essential to your mental health. Get out there when you’re up to it and do the things you like to do.Husband just underwent treatment for salivary gland tumor stage 4 now it’s metastasized to lymph nodes and now he has lung cancer. We have to wait until the 12th to talk about to them about it. We are at a nationally recognized cancer center. We trust our team and we are following their lead. The nurse who called me said stay off the lab results in the my chart app and sit tight there are a lot of treatments out there and clinical trials.

He had to get pericentesis every other week for most of that time, and towards the end, he wasn't physically able to make the trip. Most treatments gave him an adverse side effect, so he went off all treatments within a few months. With him, it was noticeable once the pain levels started increasing and the appetite severely decreased. He lost significant weight towards the end. Boost Breeze was his favorite supplement, and he started drinking them for each meal instead of once daily. He would take a few bites of food at a time, and toddler servings were the most I would give him per meal. When he had a craving for something, I did everything in my power to fulfill it.

I took her to the ER on 1/26/24 for hip pain and swelling on her side that she thought was a hernia, they did a CT scan and found masses all throughout her abdomen. It was so shocking to hear after sitting in the ER for 6 hours awaiting the likely news that she would need hernia surgery. Turns out there was no hernia, it was a giant mass. She was admitted and after MRIs and tests, stage IV lung cancer with 30+ tiny brain metastases. The outlook was optimistic from the oncology team, considering how advanced her disease was. They gave her a year and a half. She did targeted radiation for the brain tumors and got through 2 chemo treatments (w/ immunotherapy). She did have the biomarker testing and qualified for a trial, which she didn't live long enough to participate in. She passed on 4/16, on my birthday. It only took 12 weeks. She started to decline from day 1 of diagnosis, losing the ability to walk, use the bathroom, see, think/talk clearly, etc. The chemo/immuno was working on the disease in her body, but the damage to her brain was too great. Turns out she was having mini strokes, despite being on Eliquis, which really baffled the Doctors. Just before we got that last piece of news, she had decided she was done with treatment. She was only on hospice for 6 days. I share my story to show that you are not alone. This monster of a disease is wreaking havoc on many of us. I am haunted by my thoughts of what I could've done differently if I had known she would be gone so quickly. It helps for me to share these thoughts with people I trust or in a forum like this. If I don't, I feel consumed by it. I've also learned that setting aside some time where you plan to just feel the pain helps my ability to focus on tasks (like work or kid stuff) during other times. If my grief is triggered by a thought or memory, I remind myself that I can explore that more during my planned time. Sometimes I include my 11 y/o daughter in these planned times (they were super close).

And a completely fucked up way of handling the financial strain and toll it will take on you. Because so many value money more than life and that’s a sad reality. But there are tons of resources out there to find. Keep asking questions and keep seeking help when you need it. Advocate for yourself. Don’t go overboard and be demanding or pushy or dwell on things 24/7. But if your doctors aren’t explaining things or if you have questions, please ask. Please press for answers. It will be overwhelming at times. But you will get the hang of it. Find your support group. Whether that’s 1 person or many. Cling to them when you need them. Tell them when you don’t. Ignore people who have anecdotal tales of cures and remedies. Ignore those who have a friend of a friend or an uncle that they try to compare you to. Or they say died or has survived for x, y and z reasons. Those people they are talking about aren’t you. Each patient is different. And a great doctor will know the differences, your friend or family member won’t. Stay positive, but don’t go crazy or feel ashamed or bad when you get negative, because you will at times. That’s ok. You have to deal with things as they come, and they may come fast. Best advice I think I can give is live your life. Find peace and joy and love wherever you can and get rid of anything, including people, who don’t bring you peace joy and love! It may not mean much, but there are thousands and thousands and thousands of us who know exactly where you are mentally, and 99.999999% of us are rooting like crazy for you and everyone else facing this fucking disease.

I can’t for the life of me figure out how to share it on this thread or even this reply (Reddit noobie honestly) but to describe it it was literally like a bit of my tongue bulged out on the side of my tongue. It was way different than my previous biopsies of oral lichenplanus that I had (flat white patches) this was skin colored (same color as my tongue so muscle colored???) but irritated coloring like red around the edge. It was not hard but definitely had “mass” to it if that made sense. I couldn’t push it in like a sack of liquid. It was oval in shape and very smooth looking edges I didn’t think much of it till my ent said that cancer can actually be painful and hurt some people don’t realize. At the time it didn’t hurt when she said it but a few days prior to the removal and biopsy it grew incredibly painful at times. I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t eat it would get excruciating. I was hoping that it was a placebo of anxiety of dealing with this different looking spot on my tongue and thinking the worst case scenario but it turns out the pain was real and it had its reason as to why.The joke part I’m already at. A coworker who knew what had happened told me to watch my tongue over a cheeky comment I had made to him I smiled and said “don’t worry I already am.” And he realizes what he had said and apologized.

Spent some time in and out of the hospital, longest stay was 24 days, and was re-staged from 3 to 4 post op. They gave me another 6 rounds and that wrapped up this past October. Getting the dogs is one of the better decisions I’ve made in the last couple of years. Having something to be responsible for gave me a lot of drive to push through.

655,Takoska_,"I'm so sorry to hear that. A diagnosis like that is a life-changing experience. Leukaemia is a type of cancer that in most cases is not your fault. No behavior or diet is to blame. Mutations happen all the time. Most of the time, your immune system is there to kick the degenerated cells in the ass. But sometimes cells manage to trick the immune system. Boom, you got cancer. But leukaemia is now quite treatable, better than some tumors. Even if blood cancer sounds frightening at first, you have a good chance of coming out of it unscathed. I don't know much about myeloproliferative types, though. The most important thing is that it's okay to be afraid. Even if others may be worse off. I had leukaemia when I was 15. I'll be 20 this year. At first I was afraid. I didn't know what I was going to do with school or my private life. But I realized that you can still enjoy life with cancer. Sometimes life even becomes more beautiful. You gain a completely different perspective on life. Life itself and being alive becomes something beautiful to enjoy every second, especially if you don't know how long you will stay. I've realized that I'm really interested in my therapy and my illness. Next year I'm starting my medical studies. If you can't get anything positive out of your situation, that's OK. It's absolutely OK to feel fear, anger and despair. Ask at your clinic if there's a psychosocial service. They'll be able to help you.

660,Terrible-Big-Baby888,"Sounds ideal but.. when you’re sick and exhausted and defeated and angry (but heavy on the sick part)… all of this is MORE energy being dispersed.. when you already have so little. I do wish that these acts would change things, but they hardly do. A lot of people recommended I go back and tell these doctors/APRNs off but I’m tired—I didn’t want to feel more exhausted after poppin off.. so idk, just wanted to share my two cents.Yep—always push and demand what you know you need. I had a similar experience being dismissed that everything I was experiencing was only side effects of medications I was on… again, until I couldn’t walk and was in so much pain I ended up at the ER too.. (I’m also in my early 30s). It makes me angry to think of how many times I was expressing symptoms of something going wrong and they dismissed it. I can 100% sympathize with you. I hope that the medicine continues to do what it needs to do to get everything under control. Moral of the story: only YOU know your body best so KEEP FIGHTING FOR YOU! Nobody else will!!!It sure is a fucked up system that has killed a lot of people. I’m not surprised it was a female doctor that finally listened (don’t care if I sound sexist..). And I’m also not surprised that you still talk with her. My breast surgeon saved my life and I tell her that alllllll the time. I would say she still saves my life because she advocates for me often. I’m happy to hear that you are alive today. And that someone did finally listen to you. It is scary when you hear how little time you could’ve had if you hadn’t been so persistent. I wish you the absolute best.Hey—I can relate to a lot of what you’re saying regarding feeling like you’ll be yourself again OR even the having to begin the “journey” over. We’re tired. We’re defeated. We’re isolated and alone. We’re beat up but most of all.. we’re scared. I learned the hard way that if you are able to.. and up to it.. and not too sick.. you HAVE to be your own advocate.. fight for what you know you need. Demand it. Also.. fuck the medical bills (but I understand that feeling of rage/anger/underlying stress of being unable to pay/refusing to pay).. but.. shred them. Trash them. Remember the quality of your life has no price tag on it. And those bills will NOT matter when we’re at the final stages of this “journey.” I too kicked ASS at treatment last year to only end up sicker and in a way more severe state this year. It’s not fair at all & we have no choice if we want to live a bit longer. Anyways, I don’t think we will ever feel like ourselves again. So much of our “selves” has been taken from us without any of our say… so I am trying to work hard at grieving my previous self and I recommend you trying to do the same. And in my grieving (which we’re grieving so much more than that)… I’m gaining acceptance of my situation (as best I can). It’s heartbreaking and only YOU understand the devastation. Despite your situation resonating with me—still, only YOU understand YOUR devastation. But we can never go back to before our diagnosis or our battle to beat cancer. We can only keep moving forward. I don’t mean to use toxic positivity because fuck that, I’m bout to spazz on the next person that uses that on me.. but if we can have moments of hope, and moments of acceptance and moments of still loving ourselves.. then we will take it. Because yes, we are tired. We are beat up. We’re scared. We lack trust in the medical field. And we feel alone.. I’m here. New to Reddit but figuring it out & seeing there are communities here that truly support (and real dumbasses that are entertainingly stupid). You may message me anytime. We can chat isolation and devastation. You’re not alone, just like I’m not alone.You want to feel “boring” in this community.. could be perceived as insensitive to those that have situations that are certainly anything but “boring.” I just hope you are doing better and that your breast cancer does not return. Cancer in any-way-shape-or-form is not “boring.”I was re-diagnosed in June. June 18th to be exact. Stage 4, working on maintenance chemo/hormone therapies to extend my life/quality of life.. I’m sure how we are feeling at this current time is quite similar. I’m struggling to be positive and hopeful but there are good days/bad days, I am sending you love & and big hug. Cancer survivors are some of the baddest, strongest, most resilient people I know. Thank you for sharing & giving me an opportunity to relate to someone,I take CBD/THC infused gummies before bed to help with nausea/sleep/appetite. I do also smoke but I’d stick with the gummies for mom. Remind her.. none of this is ideal but we want her better and part of that is getting through chemo & being able to eat.

671,This-Army6223,"Yes I did it. Dealing with stage 4 Endometrial cancer , a rare aggressive kind. I did many lines of treatment since May of 2023 and none of them got rid of it. It started spreading again despite other medications etc. In June , the oncologist told me that he wanted to start taxol again . That was my option. I told him nope. It was horrendous before and I was not doing it again if it wasn't even going to cure it. Once you quit treatment , your doctor recommends you for hospice. I believe you need a prognosis of six months or less for hospice. I love my hospice nurse. She comes once a week right now , unless I can convince her to do a telehealth visit. She makes medication suggestions and everything is at the doorstep next day.Right now I'm still active and busy. I'm dealing with overall body aches and pains like when you have the flu, and liver pain. But I take pain meds that are available to me and I do normal as much as possible. I go out often, drive places , cook, etc. Once you are on hospice, they will stop treatment for everything. So just be aware of that. For instance, they suspected that I had a blood clot in my leg. I was told since I'm in hospice it was not going to be treated, however if I wanted it to be treated I could take myself off of hospice, have whatever procedure done, and then sign myself right on again the next day. So it's not like once you're on hospice you're stuck there. You can take yourself off if you decide to have a treatment etc. I hope this helps. For me, it was an easy choice because chemo was such hell, and I wasn't about to do that again if it wasn't going to result in at least a remission etc.Also , I would strongly suggest an antidepressant. The kind of crap we've dealt with would leave anyone with a scrambled brain. I was crying constantly. I told my oncologist flat out I was not okay. She recommended me to the hospital's cancer psychiatrist who put me on a low dose of antidepressant. It's honestly been extremely game changing for me. The hospice nurse can also can give medications for anxiety etc. I'm so sorry you're dealing with all this crap.Wow, you are a rock star! That's amazing!Also understand that you can pick and choose what to do with hospice. I find my hospice nurse to be amazingly chill and flexible. I decided to stop the social worker services. I wasn't crazy about her constant talk about needing to know all my funeral arrangements etc. and how do I feel about becoming incapacitated etc ( I think it's great, how would you feel??) I am still living here and now and very active and want to focus on that for now. So no more social worker. No chaplain because I have a wonderful pastor and his wife who look after me by calling every couple of days to pray with me and talk etc. My adult kids who live at home are in counseling and my husband starts counseling this week. So adding a social worker to the mix is just more time away from doing all i want to do and they are a-okay with all that.I find hospice to be very flexible and reassuring. I sought their help long before I really needed it and it absolutely put my mind at ease. It took me a week to build up the courage to call once the doctor put in the recommendation, but im glad I did.No it's normal. I am battling endometrial cancer at 55. I have permanent sags under my eyes from crying this past year. Let me tell you, you need to get help. I finally bottomed out and said I need help. They set me up at the hospital psychiatrist who put me on an antidepressant. It helped immediately. I'm also on Ativan as needed. They honestly do not understand the psychological and emotional impact of cancer. I'm hoping that once you get the surgery you start to feel better. A lot of this is dread and fear. All of your emotions are normal and you're not going crazy. Cancer is a rape and a thief ; it steals from you, it violates your body it invades your life and your plans. Everything that you're going through is normal however that doesn't mean that you have to endure it. There are medications that can help you. I've never been on an antidepressant in my life and never thought I needed it. However within a week of starting to take the anti depressant I began to be able to think clearer. Horrible anxiety went away. Hang in there and check back in because there were many people here who know exactly how you feel.Totally get it , I have a very rare and aggressive endometrial and yet another friend today is trying to send me another alternative remedy. I told her please don't. I've tried them ALL and nothing worked and all the regular medical stuff didn't either. People think cancer is cancer. Chris beat cancer so that means you can too. Never mind that every cancer and every body is different! Ugh it's frustrating. I finally just said ""look, it's me and God now and I'm at peace with whatever happens. If I get an unexplained miracle, I'm at peace. If I go home, I'm at peace. But I'm not chasing down the next snake oil or rabbit hole"". People don't understand that not all cancer is the same. Treatment for endometrial is vastly underfunded because it's so rare. Treatment for metastatic breast cancer HAS come a long way because it's so common and so well funded. People don't get it. They aren't all the sameI had a friend on another group in 2010 who was given 36 months with metastatic breast cancer in several places. She had two babies. She ended up living about ten more years. Hand in there mama, a moms desire to live is the greatest of all because of her children. Praying a great treatment for you to knock this down and out for many good years with your family!I stopped chemo. It wasn't working and the option I had to knock it back was hard chemo again. I said no way. If it was just gonna give me extra months forget that crap. I thought I'd die on taxol the first time around. No way. Now I'm active and living well but on hospice. The tumors hurt and have grown a lot. But I'm still here. This is a decision that you have to make, nobody else. Just like mine was. I remember talking to my mom about it, and she said nobody can make that decision except you. I was honestly sick and tired of being a patient, sick and tired of being with the cancer center constantly, sick and tired of low blood counts pain and all the other things that come along with cancer treatment. I did it for a year and a half and basically had nothing to show for it at the end of that. So my situation is a little different than yours. It sounds like your chemo has somewhat kept it at bay so you have to make the choice to keep going with it and can you live with the side effects, or to just say no more. There's no one that can tell you what is right or wrong except for you. Nobody who hasn't gone through this can possibly understand what it's like. I'm really tough and I can power through a lot if it's got a good end result, but for me it was just going to prolong things. I think if I was given the option of a treatment that would possibly eradicate it and put me into remission , I would do that. This is a discussion you need to have with your oncologist as well. My oncologist was really great. He told me he wanted to put me back on taxol since then the other chemos were working, and I told him no. He said,""talk to me"". I appreciate it that he was so open to listening. I told him that there was no way I was doing taxol again. It was crappy in 2010 when I did it for breast cancer but it was far more crappy and I thought I would die when I did it last year for endometrial cancer and I'm not doing it again. He listened to me and didn't try to change my decision and was completely respectful of that. He did make sure that I knew that no treatment meant that the disease would progress. I told him I wasn't afraid.Pathology shouldn't show the stage, stage is determined by the location of the tumor(s) and size. If cancer spreads from its original place to an organ or bones that is called stage 4. That being said people can live with stage 4 cancer for many years depending on treatment , etc. I'm sorry , nothing sucks more than bad cancer news. Push your doctor for next steps! If it's just in one location often they can surgically remove it or radiate it.I'm surprised with stage 2 that you didn't need chemo. I had chemo at stage 2a. I guess it depends on the grade. Anyway chemo for breast cancer is def doable. Keep on your anti nausea meds. Do you know who Lorna Luft is? Judy Garlands daughter. She's a singer in her 70s now. Well she had breast cancer and it came back in her ribs and a spot on her brain. She had surgery for both and treatment and they removed some of her ribs etc. My point is that she's back to doing concerts the past few years since that happened! And living a very full life. Often breast cancer can be lived with for a long long time. Take one day at a time. Don't fear chemo. Take one chemo at a time. Just keep focused on the day in front of you.I had palliative radiation to my hip even though I already had pelvic radiation. A good radiation oncologist will assess how much radiation you've had to an area and see if they can give you a couple doses more. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Bone mets suck. Mine absolutely throbbed. The radiation did help.Honestly you can't. You just need to keep telling them every cancer is different and your care team knows what kind yours is, etc. It is maddening I know. I recently stopped treatment because nothing is working and I have a friend who insisted that there was a kind of chemo that has zero side effects and it kills everything cancer. It's like yeah I think that if that was available to me it would be available to me. Kept insisting that I asked my doctor so I finally did just to shut her up and no it's not an option and yes it has a ton of side effects. People see or hear one thing online or they see some kind of TV commercial or something and they think they have the answer. It really makes everything about cancer even harder when you have people coming at you from all sides with all sorts of "" cures"" some of the medical and some of them are not. There was a woman at church who constantly approaches me and I finally just keep telling her no. No, no more. I think she finally got the clue this last time. The hard thing is that these people mean well and they want to see you well. But they have no idea that it's very taxing to hear this kind of thing coming at you from all directions.Delta 8 gummies helped me with nausea and allergies but I'm ultra sensitive and I didn't like how they made me feel. I couldn't even tolerate a half in without being buzzy. Can she layer compazine and zofran together?I wouldn't have read the results. I never looked at my reports until I was sitting with the doctor. But since you already did, just know that I had a solid lymph node at my collar bone after having a mastectomy. I totally lost my mind. They scanned it and it was a solid mass. They surgically removed it and biopsied it and it was nothing, just what they called a benign ""reactive node"". Idk why it was solid but it was nothing at all. That was in 2011. Also immunotherapy can cause massive lung nodules. I imagine other drugs can too. I know someone whose lungs were full of them after keytruda and now they are all gone. So don't panic now.

I'm slowly getting back to a length I'm comfortable with so that has helped me feel better. I also wanted everything to be normal again waaay too quickly. Started working my normal hours again like not even 2 months post chemo. It was a big mistake and I couldn't handle it. I took a big step back and decided to take everything more slowly. Baby steps are honestly the best thing you can. Do everything at your own pace and give it all the time you need. Slowly, little by little, you'll start to feel more like yourself again.

Treated with radiation, all signs point to tumor killed, and offered spot in immunotherapy clinical trial to see about using durvalumab to prevent reoccurance. Mine is a double blind study, where I dont know if I'm getting the placebo or the real drug. I opted to do it, despite the possible side effects, because it can come back and because it means they'll be keeping a much closer eye on me than if I wasnt in trial. I get a CT more frequently, PET scans more frequently, and meet with oncologist more frequently. Because of this more frequent testing, we caught 2 large colon polyps right before they became cancerous (they lit up on PET scan, but were declared precancerous when removed and tested). So, that keeping a closer eye on things has already paid off (I'm a little over a year into the trial). Is the flying to Houston every 4 weeks for my clinical trial a bit of a pain? Yes.

I just recognize that this November 29th, it will be 2yrs that I graduated the survivorship program, made it to 5yrs post cancers, and they kicked me out of the oncology clinic, my dr said ""go away, i never wanna see you again!, now get lost!"" 😂 I was alone, walked to my car stunned, kinda felt like being dropped like a hot potato for real! Then nobody to even call to share my good news with. I just sat in the car and cried. I cried tears of joy, tears of relief, and strangely tears of grief! The oncology clinic at that point had been a main stay in my life for amost a decade! So yeah, November 29th is 2yrs, and i did keep the hospital bracelet from that day. All the other dates i think i made a point to forget, and there was no bell ringing or acknowledgment of my last treatment, not from anyone. the only date that i remember is april 17th, the day of my first chemo treatment, which was terrifying af! I wish i could forget that date, but its stuck in my mind prob forever.It's going to take a few years to build up strength and also to adjust to things that changed permanently from having had cancer. That includes mentally. Everyone treats you different, be respectful, but create your boundaries with those around you of what you will and won't tolerate. To this day there are certain foods, words, things, practices that I don't want around me because it reminds me of my chemo days. Those who know about them, need to respect this. I've got some family and friends that act shocked if the topic comes up, as if they just rather erase a painful life altering time in my life like it didn't happen at all.

700,Urawinner1945,"Hey there! I'm sorry you're having to go through this, and if it's any help, I'm here for you. I (edit: 24M) was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma about 2 months ago, (it's also a blood cancer), and I know I was terrified for a bit before I started to come to terms with it, and what it means. The most important thing to remember is that it's okay to feel. It's okay to feel scared, mad, upset, or anything else. Let yourself feel your emotions, and do your best to handle them in a safe, healthy way. Some things that helped me were remembering that my DNA (and presumably yours too!) didn't decide to mutate all of a sudden, what almost certainly happened is that like happens almost every day, a few cells messed up when they did their growing thing. Usually the body is really good at catching this, and killing and recycling the cells before they cause any issues. How a cancer happens is that the body just missed a cell or two, and happens to miss them enough times that it grows to a point where the body can't stop it on its own. There is good news though, for starters, is that you caught it! The first step to dealing with any issue, even one as scary and daunting as this, is knowing what the problem is. If you haven't already scheduled an appointment with an oncologist to figure out your stage, and what your treatment will be, that's your best next step. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it's gonna be a fun time dealing with this, but it's not gonna be the end of the world either, after all you've had your cancer for at least long enough for a symptom to show that made you get it checked out. The big change is that now you know what's going on with your body, and can work towards fixing it, so you can get back to what you were already doing. Do what research you can about your cancer, so you can ask your oncologist the questions that matter to you. Listen to your doctors, and reach out to your support people when you need them. If you need extra support, we're all here for each other. Try to stay positive, and make sure to still make time for your hobbies and interests.

She was on a full dose of them for almost a month to manage her brain swelling. Once she got tapered off it was another month of being on steroids. So basically two months or so on dexamethasone. The steroids REALLY affected her mood. She was snippier and less patient. More jittery and anxious. Angry at times. Once she was off the steroids her mood improved a lot (although chemo was another beast on top of that). Now that she’s off everything her mood is much better. Her memory is definitely affected. She struggles to keep track of new information, especially small stuff. Also she has been swapping the order of numbers around. She also finds it harder to communicate because people talk faster than her brain can process. I help her manage her schedule and organize appointments because information can just slip away from her. WBRT is definitely not easy but for my mom it was the right choice in the moment to stabilize her because she was so symptomatic from the brain swelling.

713,Warthog__,"I'm a cancer patient for Plamablastic Lymphoma, a rare and aggressive cancer. No one should ever say that to you, because they cannot know that. Honestly, it may not be OK. And it is ""OK not to be OK"". Cancer sucks, disease sucks, it is horrible, and the reality is that only your doctors will be able to give you any truth. And even then all they can give you is a probability--essentially a dice roll. There are no guarantees. That's the truth of it. People's hearts are in the right place. We are taught empathy and to try to make people feel better and lift them up and give them hope. We aren't taught how to talk about cancer in a healthy way. Honestly, some of it is because so much of this stuff is new. It used to be you got cancer and you died. The whole surviving and treatment thing is relatively new. I cannot imagine what it is like for you as a parent. As much as it sucks for me, I'd rather be dealing with it myself a million times over than have my child deal with it. Going back to the dice roll analogy. Every roll of the dice with cancer treatment costs something. And not talking about money. The toll it takes on your body and mind is unimaginably hard--chemo, radiation, surgery. I think every cancer patient should have that conversation with their doctor on what they are buying.

718,WhodatSooner,"👏👏👏I don’t know the lingo exactly but I have clear cell renal carcinoma. Is that RCC?Hahaha 😂. It’s like you are a different person. I’m a Cajun / Creole guy who loved Hatch Chile season and cooking paella with fresh rosemary and high quality saffron. My wife is a Laos chef so she makes a papaya salad that would buckle your knees and a Larp that would throw so many flavors and textures that you could eat it for days in a row and never get bored. And all of that is long gone. All of those subtle flavors and balanced ingredients- the freshness of good shrimp, the pop of cilantro in a ceviche? Bye bye.😂✌️❤️🫵Yeah. You got it. Even if / when they stop treating you for whatever reason, it’s the fight to keep trying to live and love as much as you possibly can - no matter what it takes- for one day. And if you wake up, try to do it again but be ok with yourself if you can’t.I never got back to anything resembling good. I’m terminal, so surgery, radiation and chemo were all just attempts to relieve pain and maybe prolong life. They did both to a degree, but yeah, all of the things you mentioned are just the new normal. Some days better than others but we try our hardest to just keep living until I don’t. We’ve made some pretty good memories that we weren’t supposed to have a chance at. Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but if / when I think about what I was “before” it crushes my spirit. When I decide to just fight through the misery and the pain, we usually manage to enjoy life. We can’t do it every day, or even every month, but sometimes we can and it’s worth it. I’m blessed with a very special woman who plays by the official “through sickness and in health” rule, and she never overreacts in either direction. I think that helps. Just try to keep trying when you can and forgive yourself when you can’t. ✊✌️❤️🫵I am so sorry. Yes, it’s very scary when you learn that there is no cure for your particular brand of cancer and even the oncologists can only say something like “maybe 2 years but prepare for 3 months”. I made my 2 years and there have been many of those days I would like to give back. I would have preferred 3 months without pain to 2 years of this but then every once in awhile I manage to string together maybe 5 good days in a row. So I have no wisdom to share other than to try to recognize that it’s ok to feel like shit. Don’t feel bad about feeling bad. Try to allow yourself to take advantage of the better days somehow. Anything to make that day different will do. Sometimes that means I have enough energy to cook and feel good enough to actually eat some of it. And don’t take any shit from anyone ever again. I was a smoker and like you, what I have is entirely unrelated to that according to every oncologist I’ve talked to and all of the research I’ve done on my own. But at the beginning I had to hear that shit from some people and then there were other people who I knew were saying that about me because I knew what catty gossips they were. I cut them all out of my life completely. In fact, I cut everyone out of my life other than my family and my two closest friends. I actually put together a message I sent out to well meaning people who with good intentions would call or text me to “check in.” I couldn’t fucking take it so I told them all that I was cutting them out and my reason for doing so. I didn’t apologize. That was something I needed to do to get by so I did it. Maybe you prefer more attention and if so then by all means cultivate those relationships. The point is it’s ok to be selfish in this regard one way or another. I have six children (ages 32-16) two grandchildren and a wife I absolutely adore so those are plenty o feelings for me to be concerned with now. Not my old law partners or old teammates or anyone else. Also, for me, marijuana is very helpful and it’s a little known secret that anyone can get it mailed to you legally unless you live in Idaho. I get mine from Mood or Cheech & Chong. For me, I had awfully bad experiences with all of the opioids and narcotics. They even tried some sort of steroid on me and I literally went into a full blown roid rage. Scared the living shit out of everyone including me. I do take the slow release OxyContin three times a day so I’m officially a junkie (it’s a living hell if I miss a dose; the withdrawal symptoms kick in hard and fast), and I take gabapentin for nerve damage caused by spinal tumors but that’s it other than weed. It’s absolutely criminal that we are made to believe that we can’t use it legally unless we live in a state that has “legalized” it. I live in Texas and UPS delivers my weed to my front door. No problem and there’s not a goddam thing that someone who doesn’t live in this body can do about it. And hang in there with us. Finding this sub has been so important for my mental health. Give us a try and see if it works for you too. ✌️❤️🫵Yeah. I’ve been there for a couple of weeks now. I’m having some luck with Iberogast. A lot of the digestive pain ends up being a gas thing but after all of the side effects from all of the stuff we’ve been through, the mind assumes it’s constipation. But no kidding brothers & sisters, the abdominal/ digestive stuff can be worse than the tumor pain (and they might be related). Don’t suffer in silence. ✌️❤️🫵✊Then don’t. I told four people: my two closest friends and two of my former law partners. I asked them all to keep it to themselves. Two did, two clearly didn’t and I know which two didn’t based on who else I heard from.

It’s typically found in older homes. Especially those with basements. You would need to contact the city or environmental protection for a test kit.Hello. I’m 28F stage 4 NSCLC with Atrx mutation. I got a Lobectomy done (LLL) as well as a Lung resection (LUL) You’re right cancer is unpredictable. I ended up on a clinical trial- after failure with chemo and immunotherapy. When the cancer progressed I had a Tumor ablation (Aliya- PEF ablation) performed. So far the tumor is shrinking! My best advice considering your young age and being that you’re considered relatively healthy; your best bet is to get everything and anything done while your body can still handle it. At least that’s how my doctors and I are going about my prognosisI’m a lot younger than your father 28F so recovery was pretty easy for me. I was initially diagnosed with stage 3A NSCLC now stage 4; and had a Lobectomy done. I’m asthmatic as well and I had an active actinomycosis infection in my lung during the surgery. I had repeated VATS procedures and another Lung resection surgery. I’m breathing better than I did when I was first diagnosed. Just make sure his asthma is well controlled with his meds and make sure he has painkillers post surgery incase he’s in pain. Feel free to message me if you have any questions!

724,WombatHat42,"Yes. Got a half sleeve one, orange also(for leukemia - APL specifically) The end of the ribbon starts at the shoulder and wraps around the arm with a few loops(forming the cancer ribbon part). I added the quote that was on the wall of the room I did chemo in on one side and a skull on the under side of the arm with the ribbon going through the eye sockets. Id like to make it a full sleeve but don’t know what to do. Then I’ve got the date of diagnosis at the bottom…12-24-07I believe I have post thrombic syndrome as well but in both legs (worse in the right). Probably the only real, noticeable side affect from the whole experience. At least that I can tell. Out of curiosity, did they ever tell you what they thought caused it? They told me the cause was unknown but could be from exposure to certain chemicals like benzine and stuff in farming sprays(I guess a lot of farmers get APL)I didn’t start noticing more effects of my adhd until my mid 20s. Idk if it was due to chemo, my football concussions or that I’ve always had it. Out of curiosity what was your treatment protocol? Curious how similar it was to mineCongrats on being in remission! How did they find out you had it? For me it was cuz I kept getting blood clots. How long ago did you finish treatment? Did you do chemo and arsenic or just arsenic? Cuz arsenic was a newer part of the therapy(by which I mean it had been around maybe 5-10years at that point so they called it new). What’s the treatment plan now? Checkups every year? For me chemo sucked, arsenic not so bad but damn ATRA pills are what killed me though. Iirc my oncologist said there were studies suggesting just arsenic was equally successful. Which when I was diagnosed it was around 80% remission rate and considered a cure after 3 years(most leukemia I guess is 5years). I never knew about the sunscreen stuff but the docs up at Mayo said though they don’t know they think benzene is a culprit. Which is common in fertilizer and though I’m not a farmer I live in the Midwest so I’m usually only a mile or less from a farm and that spray carries pretty far. Always cleaning it off my windshields in the fall. They wanted to give me Valium when I was in the hospital but I refused to admit I was depressed or had anxiety. I wish cuz if nothing else, I’d have it now for when I fly hahaI definitely get the scattered or can’t think of the right word thing. I also will say one word when I mean another. Especially when im stressed. I will be talking about A but my brain is thinking about B and every now and then I will switch a word that is related to B and say that instead lol I also had several concussions from football though so maybe some of it is long term side effects from those. Therapy is probably the right answer but like you I can’t bring myself to talk about it. I’ve always been more bury my feelings. As far as enjoying life, find little things you enjoy and make time for them. Schedule an hour every couple days to do what you want. I recently switched fields from pharmacy to IT because of the stress and not having to deal with the BS and people in general has made things so much better haha While I was still in school I decided to do study abroad as a way of a reward(used my financial aid). Felt I’ve got the chance and just went thru this shit why the hell not? So used my financial aid to study some of my premed courses in England, did neuroscience research in Taiwan and spent a year studying Russian in Russia. And travelled a ton in between. Now that I have a better paying job and have the income, I plan to start traveling again. My goal is to reach every continent, visit as much of Europe/EU as I can and get to Australia. I can’t take my money with me so why not spend it. And should my APL ever come back I figure this way I’ve done something I wanted to do.It has been just over 15 years and the only thing I still deal with is a severe leg rash. But that is from the DVTs I got due to the cancer. I had acute promyelocytic leukemia that initially presented with DVTs.

Sometimes they'll start someone on immunotherapy or chemo if the biomarkers take too long to come back.I was dx Stage 4 squamous when I was 47 so I'm a little older. Mine was inoperable. You don't mention if you've had biomarker testing. If not, I'd get it done. I ended up having a biomarker (MET amplification). I've been on targeted therapy and stable for over 5 years. I haven't had to do any chemo yet.Stable is good!!I'm sorry you're going through this, but try to hold on to hope. There is a lot of research going on and you never know when the next best thing will come out (in the Lung Cancer world, we say we just have to live until the next drug/treatment comes out). Keep yourself educated on what's going on...advocate for yourself and support others newly diagnosed. Honestly, I think those 3 things are have what kept me going. Anyway, a couple of moms in our support groups have started to write (or record) letters to their babies. Another started an Instagram with their children's name and started taking pics of them together every day, with little snippets of information.Stage 4 squamous here. I was dx in December 2018 and doing well. I do have a biomarker known as MET. So, If he has non-small cell, make sure he gets biomarker testing (Next Generation Sequencing), not just the test for the ones they have targeted therapies for. I'm sorry you're going through this. It's awful and treatment may suck, but there is hope. Not sure if you're a Facebook user, but there are support groups over there with more people.I was dx December 2018 Stage 4 squamous non-small cell with MET amplification biomarker. I'm doing very well on targeted therapy. I have no side effects now (I did when I first started, but onco gave me meds then reduced my dosage). Trust me when I say this: I was close to death...in a wheelchair, dependent on others, wearing diapers. Then I started the targeted therapy. Within 2 weeks, I was able to function again. I know not everyone will have this outcome, but please let her know there's hope.I don't know if you're a Facebook user, but there are a ton of support groups there. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1643271995958004/?ref=share&mibextid=qtnXGe EGFR Resisters: https://www.facebook.com/groups/EGFRResisters/?ref=share&mibextid=qtnXGe I've seen papers that EGFR is fairly common in Asian women, but I don't know enough about it.

I had a bag I would take to my chemo infusions. 6 months later I can’t even look at that bag without getting nauseous.This. First of all congrats on making it through! I completely freaked at my stage 4 diagnosis, but it turns out cancer can be beaten back. Even older treatments have evolved to work with new immunotherapies to great effect for many. Anyone and everyone, don’t lose hope and don’t give up. While I may not ultimately win, I’m not going out without a fight. Stay strong people!What I thought was a stomach ulcer turned out to be stage 4 gastric cancer.I’m stage 4 stomach cancer.

741,[deleted],"I have been WAGING a battle against cancer for 9 years!Comment deleted by userYou have my blessings, I'd say you'll be fineShe never cared. Leave her at the curb. You have better battles worth fighting for.AML and secondary AML (arising from other bone marrow disorder or caused by treatments for other Cancer) have different outcome and survival rate. The outcome for secondary AML said to be not-so-good. And also OP's son already diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma. Reading from OP's post history, it is sure that OP's son is having a hard time regarding his health and been dealing with a bunch of medical issues. I can only imagine how hard it is. But I agree they should discuss with their son's medical team.Cut him off. He’s still a monkey of the past. He’s not human.Having support definitely would make things a little less stressful but unfortunately my family abandoned me when I was 16 so I've been on my own ever since. I'm homeless and don't have the funds to get food or water which probably makes things worse lol. I just try to ground myself by focusing on my senses and the things around me. I really hate complaining I just needed a little space to vent to anyone who would listen. I just hope I can figure everything out. Thank you for your kind comment.So…you have CLL, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma AND Paget’s Disease?some feel different effects from these things its trickyIt sounds like we have the same dad, my dad has literally said those exact same things too lmao. I would rather die than go through chemotherapy again personally, but I also believe that the after effects are equally as shitty in their own way. I have survivors guilt, chemo brain and a few other long term side effects and I have very bad days sometimes. Cancer affects you for the rest of your life and anybody who has never had it will never truly understand our pain and trauma. I believe chemo itself and the after effects are both the absolute worst. I also stopped believing in god the day I was diagnosed. I will not worship a god that gives kids cancer. Don't listen to anybody who has never gone through it, I love my dad but I know for a fact that god was not with me during that hell.Want a macaroon?I had anxiety before cancer so I have some experience of managing it in my daily life (including medication, narrative therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy). I have terrible ""scanxiety"" when going for scans and tests .I agree, my dad truly believes that since I've been in remission for so long now that it's never going to come back and I just look at him and say nothing. There's always a chance it could and I live with that fear everyday, I do appreciate his reassurance but it's just a fear I'm going to live with the rest of my life. My tumor was in my stomach and I had really bad stomach pain before I was diagnosed with cancer and now everytime my stomach hurts I think it's a tumor and I hate it. Living with constant paranoia is not fun. I'm very sorry to hear about your cancers too, I genuinely hope you stay cancer free for life nowI'm so sorry to hear that. No one deserves this god awful diease. I hope everything works out good for you and hey, I wonder why I survived too. Every other kid I knew has died and it's the saddest thing, just know that your not alone my friend. I wish you the best of luckI like thatAmazing!!Wow, you are hella strong for going through that 🥺 Congrats on being cancer free 🙂It takes time! I was 15 when I was diagnosed (same cancer), 16 when I finished treatment, and I didn’t feel “normal-ish” until about 19. My Dr told me: Damage to our bodies is easy to do, and it happens very quickly. Recovery is harder, and it’s slow. So give yourself twice as long to heal as the time it took to do the damage… or more! It gets better, I promise you!Also a Hodgkins Lymphoma survivor here (she 15 at diagnosis) and I feel weird about being a survivor, I feel like for a LONG time during and after chemo it defined who I was. The very definition of my existing was either cancer patient or cancer survivor. I’m about to be 32 and I’ve spent more years of my living life as a survivor than the 15 years before the cancer… and it kind of makes me mad. I don’t talk about it much anymore because there’s not much of a need to and I want my life to be defined by who I am in my soul, not on a cellular level. Hey y’all, none of us are alone! Cancer puts us in weird mental places, and that ok! 🫶I was diagnosed at 17. Next month marks 40 years for me. I too figured I wouldn't last long. They told me I might get 15-20 years. Here's some advice: Don't measure yourself by others. You have experienced a trauma that they haven't. You're also experiencing an ongoing trauma that is especially impacting given your age. More and more is being learned about the physical and mental late term effects. Depending on your location, there are resources to help, especially if you're a childhood survivor. Many ""Children's"" hospitals have programs specifically for survivors of all ages. I'm fortunate to have access to one. Many of the teaching hospitals also have programs. I struggle with after effects also. My psychiatrist daignosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder due to the trauma. (A good psychiatrist can help.) I've also been told I'll need a new heart valve soon on top of the four stents I have. And occasionally I feel like I've wasted too much time trying to be ""normal.' I've had a succesful career, but I can't have children and didn't want to adopt because the idea of possibly dying with a young child didn't appeal to me. But I digress. If you'd like, you can send me a message and I'll be happy to find the resources you need. Actually that goes for anyone on this sub. If you need an advocate to help you find what you need, PM me.Survivors guilt can be horrible. I didn’t think about it too much growing up but sometimes I can’t get it out of my head. Sometimes I get depressed and wonder if the world would be significantly different if I never made it. I’d love to talk with people that understand this better. That’s one of the reasons why I’m glad I found this sub.Your feelings are valid. Well said.You’re not alone in feeling like this! I’m about to turn a weird corner for myself and it’s a happy-sad feeling: I was 15 when I was diagnosed, and I’m about to round 16 years remission which means I’ll have spent more of my life as a cancer survivor than I ever spent as a normal kid. It’s like when women get married and someday have had their married last name longer than their maiden last name? I think it becomes more difficult to remember what life was like NOT as a survivor with every passing year. And it’s a weird ass feeling… grateful to be here, dealing with long term effects, frustrated with knowing I’ve been held back in certain aspects yet overwhelmed with pride at how far I’ve come at the same time. Bag of mixed nuts!! Salty nuts at that… You’re not alone!I’m sorry for your loss but I’m glad that you’re doing okay. My situation was weird. Nobody else in my family ever had cancer. They know which chromosomes or whatever we’re messed up but they never knew why.I am also a cancer who had cancerThat’s fun! Please post pictures if you do.Ooh! Can you post pictures?Ooh! This was my first one. Can you send me a picture when you get it?You might find more people with APL in r/leukemia. I had AML. I later got meningitis during my treatment and some of my doctors think that lead to my cognitive impairment. What’s weird is I don’t remember a life without post-cancer checkups. It’s weird having nostalgia for the hospital.I don't mean to be depressing, but many pf them never go away. In my case, they showed up well after I finished treatment. I had chemo and radiation back in the 80s. If you've had mantle radation you need a good cardiologist, and if you've had any radiotherapy at all, you need to watch your thyroid. Chronic fatigue is a part of it that I struggle with. I also have high blood pressure, four heart stents, a faulty valve and my muscles don't metabolize energy correctly. I aslo don't sleep well. Other than that, I'm doing okay.Comment removed by moderatorMy mom had a very similar diagnosis. Large right lung mass and a secondary mass pushing into her esophagus/vertebrate Radiation helped immensely with the mass that was pushing against her esophagus/back and it ultimately didn’t come back. One key thing to advocate for is pain relief. My mom was a trooper and I wish I was able to convince her to go on stronger pain relief sooner for her quality of life.",948,0,0,"['start', 'i', 'waging', 'battle', 'cancer', '9', 'yearscomment',

745,_josterdam_,"Not quite the age range you mentioned buut close. I’m 24.Got diagnosed in January with breast cancer. Went through chemo and surgery and currently awaiting rads and whatever follows that. I got my diagnosis right after I had landed my dream job and at first I was devastated. I spent the first two months of chemo mourning what could have been. I couldn’t plan for the future anymore and all I could think was “this is my life now” Then I surprisingly started adjusting to the reality of cancer and things got a lot better! Somehow I was able to have goals, plans and dreams for the future again and it was great. I realized that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, even though I wasn’t (and still am not) at the end yet.As of right now Im just waiting to finish active treatment and then I’ll go after my career again. I’m young, and still full of energy and will to see and experience things so why not. My goals haven’t changed at all but I do have a new perspective of life.

750,adultingwhilelost,"Stage 3c BC when I was 27 and stage 4 at 35. With MBC it’s forever treatment but low intensity - this is the same amount of treatment as I had when I was in remission for stage 3. I had a good chunk of time to do bucket list things and establish my career between. Now I’m trying to figure out what to do with my remaining time too haha. What I would say is that life goes fast. I took the time to travel the world, live in different countries and make a name for myself professionally. But when I got to the point where I can slow down professionally to focus on the personal I got diagnosed with MBC… Being established professionally is a load off the mind when dealing with MBC because I’m now in a position to slow down without it affecting my career trajectory and tbh even before the diagnosis I knew I didn’t want to climb any further. But I am established enough that I can push back the start of a new job for radiotherapy and be accommodated. The personal side is harder because well, where is the dating pool for management level professionals with MBC in their mid 30s? There’s also the ethical dilemma of how I can promise someone romantically “forever” when my expected expiration date is a lot sooner than my partner’s? I would say concentrate on one thing at a time - time is limited for people like us and trying to be all things to all people at all time will mean you end up with nothing.

754,affenage,"What kind of surgery? I am scheduled for a lobectomy by VATS next week. Using Video Assist means very small incisions and no broken ribs. Recovery isn’t a cake walk, but I will recover up to 100% of my breathing capacity in the next months. I am 63, and honestly, as a person with early stage lung cancer I am in much better shape for this surgery than most who go through it. If I was offered an option for chemo or rads instead I wouldn’t take it. If there is no spread detected, using surgery to remove the original mass is considered as close to curative as you can get, while chemo and rads are not as successful. It took me a few weeks of deep thoughts.. and melt downs.. to reach the point that I have accepted this and can move forward. Give it time and talk it over.. good luck to you and your Dad.The stats of cancer reoccurring are not perfect, you have a much higher risk of a second cancer than the general population. It’s a clinical trial, meaning they think this may be helpful, but they do not know for certain. It is entirely up to you.. and I completely understand both choices.

757,alfriel,"Thank you! That makes me feel a bit better that the wait is normal. I have heard that about MD Anderson but I wasn't sure if that was just their main Texas location that's the best. The one near me is Cooper university with I think some sort of partnership with MD AndersonThank you so much! I didn't even know about biomarker testing until right now, I will look into it!Thank you, and same to you and yours 💜Thank you for sharing! I'm so glad that it was caught and treated quickly for you 💜We did see the oncologist and established care before the biopsy result was in. He said it was unlikely to be cancer based on the CT, but the biopsy confirmed it is. I guess I just had the impression that things would move quickly as he ordered the EBUS Stat. That makes me sad that people have to wait such a long time for care 😔I'm so sorry you're going through that! It's such a shame that things don't move quicker with such a difficult illness to have. I wish you well with your treatment and recovery 💜Thank you 💜It's so hard not to look, but I know it's not good for anything. They did call me back, and she is going to be seen this upcoming week, so things seem to be moving very quickly based on the experiences shared from others here about their wait times, and I am very grateful for that. Thanks for sharing your insights with me!I'm so sorry to hear about your husband and the long waits 😔 we haven't been offered telehealth visits as of yet, but it's good to know that it may occur during this process.I'm so sorry to hear what you're going through! I hope that your nodules are not cancerous, but that is so frustrating that they haven't done a biopsy. My mom's health has been declining for several years, and she just gets passed around from specialist to specialist with no real help until this recent ER visit. Unfortunately the Healthcare system in the US is extremely difficult to navigate and I have worked with doctors who expressed difficulties in what they're able to do for their patients as far as testing, they are heavily restricted by hospital policies and health insurance, whose number 1 priority is to make as much money as possible. We had a specialist recently say that she really needs an MRI due to spinal issues from degenerative disease and frequent falls but they can't order it until she goes through Physical Therapy for 6 weeks, 2-3 times a week and then has a f/u x-ray - only then will they be able to order what they already know is necessary. It just feels like so many hoops to jump through that delays critical treatment to improve one's quality of life and longevity. I wish I had any sort of helpful advice to share with you. Perhaps if you don't have a pulmonologist already, find a good one that is trained to perform the EBUS procedure. That went very smoothly for my mom and she has oxygen problems as well, usually O2 is 88-94 on 2-4 liters of oxygen. Thank you, and I will pray for you as well for good news on your test results 💜I just noticed your username is pinkpeony, and I have a tattoo of a pink peony on my shoulder!

Then, start making a plan, get into therapy if you can. Get a second opinion if you want to (mine changed my plan going forward and gave me some extra peace of mind.) You're not alone ❤️Yep! I have to get the ""sensitive skin"" tape/adhesive stuff. I've had a couple of laproscopic surgeries (before cancer) where the rash from the tegaderm was worse than the incisions. If you are getting an IV put in ask for the sensitive/kids bandage. It's not 100% but it is better. Often the nurses will try to cut as small a piece as possible too. If you are just doing a blood draw ask them to use the stretchy bandage or if you can just hold the gauze for a few minutes.

Felt invincible. Was diagnosed in March and felt like my whole world stopped. Went through treatment with the mindset of just doing what I needed to day by day to give myself the best chance of beating it. Became increasingly depressed and completely numb to the world during. I couldn’t work, travel, see friends, I lost my partner, my body changed, I lost my hair, felt too weak to do much at all. Thankfully I got NED in June. Had final surgery around then as well and am in monitoring now. Im absolutely infinitely grateful to be in this spot, but honestly - I don’t think I’ll be back to the person I was, the utter trauma this experience has caused has genuinely fucked me up and is indescribable to anyone who hasn’t been through it. I still read my bloodwork notes and stand there in disbelief that the damn thing says ‘malignant tumor’. I was seeing a therapist for a while, but i felt like it wasn’t helping. For now, im just focusing on the good things in life, and trying not to dwell on the future too much - it’s easy to worry sick about recurrence. I’ve built back enough strength to get out and do things, I’ve found more value in working out than I ever have before - it’s been so helpful mentally.

769,annacosta13,"Hi. I’m in a similar boat with my husband. He was diagnosed 18 months ago with SCLC which at the beginning spread to lymph nodes , lungs and adrenal glands. He had treatment which kept it all at bay. Last month MRI showed mets to the brain. He doesn’t want more treatment despite being offered whole brain radiotherapy that might or might not give him more time. Right now he has chest infection and yesterday I thought it’s the end. We are with local hospice now which have been really good to us. I guess it’s a waiting game now because nothing else can be done.

770,ant_clip,"To echo and amplify what others have suggested, because you are so depressed, why not first talk to a therapist just to talk it all out before making a decision to stop. I also agree that talking to someone from hospice might be helpful so you have a sense of what that will be like. I decided to forgo treatment. I am stage 3/4 metastatic adenocarcinoma unknown primary (CUP). I was 67, diagnosed when it metastasized to my liver. After liver resection surgery, I was told 6 months to a year no treatment and maybe 3 or 4 with treatment. I elected no treatment. In addition to being older I also have stage 4 emphysema. Context is everything. My oncologist was very supportive with my decision. It is my life, my body, it was my decision. My friends and family understand, it took a few conversations with some but they get it and respect my decision. My oncologists were really wrong with their prognosis, I am an outlier and incredibly fortunate. Still here 4 years later, a couple of small mets in lymph nodes that are very slowly growing for now. I am so very sorry you are going through this and facing this decision. If you have any questions feel free to ask or even DM me.I will be doing MAID, I am not ready yet but at some level I can relate. There is a sense of dread that is hard to describe. I suspect when you are ready, you will know it deep in your soul. Preparing is not the same as doing, preparing gives you the option should the pain be too much. You don’t have to decide until the moment you take the meds. I wish you peace.My oncologist referred me to palliative care when I brought it up, that was how I got started with palliative. Palliative has talked to me in detail about how it works, what’s involved, how I would feel and of course referrals so when the time is right I know who to contact. Having that support is extremely helpful. Maybe skip the oncologist and talk to someone from palliative care. I am not yet at the 6 month mark, I am incredibly fortunate. I think of it as a safety net to spare me from the worst, not a contract. I might never need it, I might go quickly and quietly but it’s comforting to know it’s an option should I want it.It is your choice, it is your body, your life. I would just suggest give yourself the space to change your mind. I am not doing treatment. I see my oncologist every three months and have remained open to conversations. I wish you the best, and no you are not selfish.I know the feeling myself. I also know how it feels to be alone when going through it. I am stage 3/4 metastatic adenocarcinoma unknown primary, you aren't alone. What you do is you live, you are here today so for today you live. Your medical team will help you to navigate the treatment options or whatever is appropriate for you. A therapist can help you to navigate the emotional aspect of the journey.I am terminal on palliative, not yet ready for hospice. Palliative care is mostly about keeping me as pain free as possible. They have also helped me to redo all my end of life care documents, e.g. POLST. They gave me some info and resources regarding MAID. We do a telemed every 1-2 months where we talk about pain management, my weight, am I eating well, sleeping well, etc. They prescribe my liquid morphine and an anti-inflammatory med for something else I have unrelated to my cancer. I have found it helpful, but mostly it is reassuring knowing when it starts to get bad, I know who to call and they know me. Why not just ask your oncologist or their PA about it?I had a similar experience for a while, over time I adjusted as much as a person can. For me it was not a permanent new normal, but it does take time to process. You are in the worse leg of the journey, the lack of information can be torture. There is nothing wrong with talking to a therapist that specializes in cancer patients. Wish you the best for your appointment tomorrow. Getting past this first one will help.Good for you, no need to waste precious energy and sanity on someone like that.

777,bdpna,"Wow, what a fantastic answer. So sorry to hear about your mom as well. That has to be very stressful to do all that traveling and be so far away but wow, what a fantastic kid you are. Unfortunately, my dad has not been sleeping much at night since getting the lung cancer. The primary tumor is so close to his esophagus that he has constant phlegm that is exacerbated when he tries to lay horizontal. Anything but sitting up right in the chair and he has problems. It has been really hard to watch. So maybe one positive side effect if he gets tired enough is that he will actually get real sleep. Much like your mom, my dad was celebrating losing weight before his diagnosis. Since then he has been trying to eat, but it has been a real struggle. Unfortunately, we haven’t found much that he enjoys as everything is tasteless and struggle to put down with no desire. I’m a little concerned about this so will continue to do my best to advocate that he eat even when it is the last thing on his mind. Thanks so much for that. My dad sounds a lot like your mom and his doctor meetings. I have been in every single meeting and the one asking most of the questions. My dad‘s doctor is also a little older and seems to have the clinical approach, but not really a lot of additional bedside manner. My dad doesn’t mind as he is the same way. I prefer a little more detail from the doctor and not the feeling like he’s rushing to get to the next patient or the next thing.that said, I’m pretty well schooled on what my dad has, at least more than I was a month ago. I sure do ask a lot of questions and hope to continue to ask the right ones when given the opportunity. Your mom is very lucky to have your dad. I do wish someone could always be there with him, but given him my sister’s family commitments and my work commitments that is just not a practical thing right now. We are going to do our best to be there in person as much as possible and via technology every single day. My very best wishes to you and your family during this difficult time.Thanks for the reply, my best wishes to you and your Mom in this rough time. It sure has been a stressful summer.Wow sounds like she is tolerating very well! The eating and movement are big things. My dad struggles in both now so hoping the treatment may change that for him at least during the non tired days. Wishing Continued good progress to your mom!!!Well, the day is here. I'll try and keep a journal here or start a new post if it feels more helpful. My sister is taking him to the first treatment today and we are alternating. I'll be spending several days living with him after he gets home today. From what we hear the first day and night are not bad but anywhere up to ""day 5"" (I assume treatment counts as ""day 1"") can be the worst of it, so I want to be there. Since he lives an hour away from each of us but wants to be home, this was our best plan we could devise. We are thankful for the schedule of 3 weeks between treatments though realize this means he'll be getting a lot today, so we are hoping for the best but ready for the worst with side effects. I'll share that stuff here when I get a chance, just hoping that we are ready. Ironically (probably by design) Dad had the best 2 days since diagnosis this week, the palliative radiation given to the lung tumor finally got his cough and phlegm under control, took 2 more weeks past the last treatment to finally start giving results, so it is true that radiation keeps working many weeks or even months (TBD?) after it ends. Of course, after those good 2 days he's right back into the dumps with the chemo starting today. Our biggest concerns are if he will have issues with bathroom activities (that has been a struggle between constipation and the other extreme) and his weight loss continues at about 3 pounds per week due to lack of appetite. We're expecting him to mostly just want to sleep and be inactive during the first week of each chemo cycle. So it will be a challenge to get him to drink and eat if he is mostly sleeping. And then we are of course hopeful to avoid the nausea. I will post more when I can in the days ahead, any feedback always helpful. Also hoping this post can be useful to any others down the road who are going through a similar medicine combo.As promised here's an update. We are on day 5 after the first infusion. Figure I can leave this all here, helpful to those who may find it later, as other posts on history of treatments have helped us to get ready. So due to the steroid he had a great day at treatment, they treated him well with meds and comfort in a massage chair and snacks. He enjoyed the day very much and ""loved"" chemo. Ha! He had a huge energy burst that lasted the next 2-3 days after treatment due to steroids in the IV as well as the pills. We are on day 5 now and this is the start of the ""crash"". I will note the palliative radiation to his primary in his chest finally started to have positive effects just before the chemo which helped resolve his cough and appetite somewhat. So that plus the steroids, he has been able to return to bed to sleep and eating/drinking while nowhere near regular levels did increase. He tried some normal non-sugar food and was able to get some down also was able to drink way more fluids after chemo. Which I hope will help. Top two issues on day 5, constipation which has been a problem for a while now, we are trying to work on it via a once daily stool softener as well as a laxative pill. We will talk to the docs if these OTC meds do not work. Second side effect started setting in yesterday that is getting worse today is muscle pain and some neuropathy. He is having some trouble walking and having to be VERY careful. Muscle pain was so bad he was unable to sleep last night. We are going to try and manage with OTC tylenol but if it gets no better or worse with the pain and inability to sleep we'll talk to the doc. That's where we are on day 5. My hope is that we have a few rough days and then he gets some better more normal days in the 21 day cycle. Then it starts all over again for at least 5 more treatments. Will try and keep this post updated. As always welcome any comments or questions.More updates, again for anyone interested who finds this thread later or anyone with questions or comments now. Dad had second infusion on Friday, this time added Zometa for bone strengthening, the Keytruda, The Taxol (a 3 hour infusion) and the Carboplatin. The taxol is the most brutal of the bunch from what I am reading, with the carboplatin not far behind. Hair loss began about 2 weeks in, still some hair at week 3 but lots falling out as we start the second infusion at 21 days. Infusion days are easy due to steroid given during the process. The mediport worked well. During his nadir visit (halfway between first and second chemo) the white blood cell count was low as well as hemoglobin, came up in time for the second infusion. Doctor said something about needing a blood transfusion if it gets worse future times. Doctor also said he wants to CT scan the cancer areas after the 3rd treatment (9-10 weeks after first chemo) to check progress, since we are not yet seeing any signs of improvement (although I am unsure if we are supposed to, this soon either). Dad continues to have better days than others, big side effects are the following: Sleep disrupted, he sleeps when he can, often an hour here and there throughout the day, thus is not ready for bed at night and is often up half of the night. Cannot sleep on a bed but somehow can sleep on a recliner for an hour, and on a couch on his side for a few hours. We are not sure why this is. Appetite remains awful as ever, except on chemo infusion day when the steroid makes him more hungry and briefly improves taste. Otherwise most food has the wet cardboard sensation and his body rejects swallowing it, thus, eating very little and strength is very low, walking short distances has become a challenge from lack of strength as well as being out of breath The palliative radiation did cure his blood and mucous cough but the cough did return in a more dry fashion here and there for now. The lung was the primary so I guess this is the way it will be,. Constipation, rock hard stools for the first days / week after a chemo infusion. Trying to start stool softeners to manage. Neuropathy in hands fingers is pretty bothersome, also was in feet a bit, doc says Taxol causes this and lowered the dose a bit. Extreme fatigue and low feeling after the steroid pills stop being taken around day 5/6. No nausea at this point which we are at least thankful for. Fairly few words during the low days, on the high days, a lot more talking or communication, often with some repeated stuff or brain fog which may be due to some of the meds the palliative team provided to try and stimulate appetite or promote sleep (but do not seem to be working). Aggression or argumentative state can be a mix, less so on high days / steroid time, more energy and movement but often frantic or erratic. During low days, very quiet and mean. MAJOR pain in his tailbone which doc thinks is a pressure sore due to constant time in chair, not broken open yet but skin is thin there so we have concerns. Not managing with any pain meds other than tylenol which does not work. He did say pain went away after starting steroids. So it likely will return in a few days. That's about where we are at here at the three week mark. Next week, we expect the big crash and then have another Nadir visit to check his bloodwork, and an appointment with palliative care. I may ask for medical THC gummies which are approved in this state, before we move to any opioid type stuff. No other plans right now other than the horrible wait for scans after the 3rd chemo, from being here I know to expect the worst, hope for the best, but am ready for any outcome and then the doc's recommendations. Any questions let me know.

You really don’t know what to expect and things happen quickly with little notice. Ask lots of questions. Have you had a follow up CT to see if the radiation did anything?My mom is on this combo. First chemo treatment went fine with no side effects. They added Keytruda during the second treatment and she developed a fever and infection 48 hours later.

783,birdnerd0105,"I’m 23 and still going through treatment, but there are a few things that I have learned going through it that I will certainly be taking with me navigating life after it. At first, dating sounded really scary, but the one thing multiple people have truly engrained in me is that a current diagnosis or a past diagnosis is no reason to hold you back from getting out there. When you do bring it up, it is so important to remember that any reaction you might get is no reflection on you. As a funny example, recently my pants fell down in the middle of the road with people around because a wasp was attacking me and I swatted a little bit too aggressively and forgot to put on my belt that day. One lady scolded me for being indecent, but other people giggled because it was funny. My point is, my pants falling down happened and being both scolded and giggled at by different individuals is no reflection on me! If you think cancer is a definite dealbreaker, it’s NOT. So don’t let that get in your way!!! Just remember to stay true to yourself and know that dating does not change just because of cancer. I’m still in university so I can’t speak professionally, but as for school, I appreciate the opportunities to learn and grow in a way that I didn’t entirely grasp before. My time off has allowed me to explore the kind of things I really enjoy in life which has put me on a completely new path. I wish I never had cancer, but in a way I’m thankful that I’m so young because now I know what I want to do for the rest of my life. I’m using it as a tool to help build a professional career I love in the future. Perspective on life for me has also changed. I realized that a lot of things I stressed over before are out of my control and at the end of the day, don’t really matter. Cancer is out of my control and I can’t do anything but get the treatment. For example, I have always had long hair and was heartbroken when it fell out, but that was out of my control so I got some sweet toques I feel good in because that’s in my control. I focus on what is in my control to live more stress-free. After getting this in my head, my mental state has certainly changed for the better. My idea of being successful changed too. To me, success is now building a life I am truly happy with and always remembering to be there in the moment. One more thing I learned is that it is extremely important to be in touch with your feelings and accepting you’re going to have good days and bad days in life cancer or not, and that you shouldn’t be afraid to be in touch with those feelings. I try my best to keep a positive attitude, but other days I am the biggest grouch in town who cries at dropping a fork on the ground because I am sad about what’s going on. And I realize it is okay to feel that way! And that realization and acceptance is key. My best friend from the cancer clinic told me that the only way out of cancer is through, and while the journey through can feel so discouraging and challenging, you need to cut yourself a break and be proud of yourself. To me, for anyone navigating life after cancer, some things might include focusing on yourself, your goals, your needs, what makes you happy, and living in the moment. And most importantly, to be proud of yourself and never settle because life is simply too short to not feel fulfilled.",324,0,0,"['start', 'i', '’', '23', 'still', 'going', 'treatment', 'things', 'i', 'learned', 'going', 'i', 'certainly', 'taking', 'navigating', 'life', 'at', 'first', 'dating', 'sounded', 'really', 'scary', 'one', 'thing', 'multiple', 'people', 'truly', 'engrained', 'current', 'diagnosis', 'past', 'diagnosis', 'reason', 'hold', 'back', 'getting', 'when', 'bring', 'important', 'remember', 'reaction', 'might', 'get', 'reflection', 'as', 'funny', 'example', 'recently', 'pants', 'fell', 'middle', 'road', 'people', 'around', 'wasp', 'attacking', 'i', 'swatted', 'little', 'bit', 'aggressively', 'forgot', 'put', 'belt', 'day', 'one', 'lady', 'scolded', 'indecent', 'people', 'giggled', 'funny', 'my', 'point', 'pants', 'falling', 'happened', 'scolded', 'giggled', 'different', 'individuals', 'reflection', 'if', 'think', 'cancer', 'definite', 'dealbreaker', '’', 'not', 'so', '’', 'let', 'get', 'way', 'just', 'remember', 'stay', 'true', 'know', 'dating', 'change', 'cancer', 'i', '’', 'still', 'university', 'i', '’', 'speak', 'professionally', 'school', 'i', 'appreciate', 'opportunities', 'learn', 'grow', 'way', 'i', '’', 'entirely', 'grasp', 'my', 'time', 'allowed', 'explore', 'kind', 'things', 'i', 'really', 'enjoy', 'life', 'put', 'completely', 'new', 'path', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'never', 'cancer', 'way', 'i', '’', 'thankful', 'i', '’', 'young', 'i', 'know', 'i', 'want', 'rest', 'life', 'i', '’', 'using', 'tool', 'help', 'build', 'professional', 'career', 'i', 'love', 'future', 'perspective', 'life', 'also', 'changed', 'i', 'realized', 'lot', 'things', 'i', 'stressed', 'control', 'end', 'day', '’', 'really', 'matter', 'cancer', 'control', 'i', '’', 'anything', 'get', 'treatment', 'for', 'example', 'i', 'always', 'long', 'hair', 'heartbroken', 'fell', 'control', 'i', 'got', 'sweet', 'toques', 'i', 'feel', 'good', '’', 'control', 'i', 'focus', 'control', 'live', 'stressfree', 'after', 'getting', 'head', 'mental', 'state', 'certainly', 'changed', 'better', 'my', 'idea', 'successful', 'changed', 'to', 'success', 'building', 'life', 'i', 'truly', 'happy', 'always', 'remembering', 'moment', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'learned', 'extremely', 'important', 'touch', 'feelings', 'accepting', '’', 'going', 'good', 'days', 'bad', 'days', 'life', 'cancer', '’', 'afraid', 'touch', 'feelings', 'i', 'try', 'best', 'keep', 'positive', 'attitude', 'days', 'i', 'biggest', 'grouch', 'town', 'cries', 'dropping', 'fork', 'ground', 'i', 'sad', '’', 'going', 'and', 'i', 'realize', 'okay', 'feel', 'way', 'and', 'realization', 'acceptance', 'key', 'my', 'best', 'friend', 'cancer', 'clinic', 'told', 'way', 'cancer', 'journey', 'feel', 'discouraging', 'challenging', 'need', 'cut', 'break', 'proud', 'to', 'anyone', 'navigating', 'life', 'cancer', 'things', 'might', 'include', 'focusing', 'goals', 'needs', 'makes', 'happy', 'living', 'moment', 'and', 'importantly', 'proud', 'never', 'settle', 'life', 'simply', 'short', 'feel', 'fulfilled', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['No symptoms identified'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,['Unable to specify'],Unable to specify
784,bismaiqbal22,"At 27 I got diagnosed with breast cancer stage 2. In December, I’m gonna be getting my final scan to see if I’m officially cancer free.For me, trying to get back to what my life used to be had been pretty up and down. Hell, I found going through chemotherapy easier aha! Only because I knew I was sick and didn’t even bother worrying about my appearance. But now that I’m done and am in recovery mode, I kind of wish things would speed up, you know? So I can look myself again. Wear makeup, take pictures, go out without having people immediately recognize it’s a wig. I went from accepting a job offer out west to getting diagnosed the same day and since then, my life goals changed completely. And I know it might’ve been for their better but it still sucks. Seeing people I went to school with getting job promotions, traveling at ease, getting married etc. I admit I get jealous. Because my life’s on a completely different level now, my perspective went from enjoying life to hoping my scans come out clear. This experience took a toll on me for sure, but I guess the best I can do is take it day by day and give myself the time to heal. It’s good to think positive and be confident that everything will be okay, but I learned it’s also okay to mourn what I had and cry once in a while. And so far, I feel more at peace with myself and my life. I’m working and interviewing for jobs, can’t travel yet but go out with friends and family without feeling nervous, dating I personally want to wait on till I’m ready and just trying to enjoy the little things, which was something I never did before my diagnosis.27F with Stage 2 August of 2023.

791,briarwren,"I'm so sorry, and my thoughts are with you. This is normal, although I know it's incredibly hard waiting at first. Just be there for your mother to support her as well as possible, ensure there is someone to act as a scribe at her appointments, and don't bother with Dr. Google. You don't have enough info, and you'll only overwhelm yourself with the numbers. I speak from both sides of the fence. My mother has Stage IV small cell), and we found out completely by accident early last year when it metastasized to her brain and landed her in the ER. She had had no symptoms. We weren't shocked per se about the cancer itself since she's smoked for over 50 years, and my grandmother also had lung cancer. What we were shocked about was that it was such a late stage with no discernible symptoms. She had brain surgery and radiation to treat what was left in the brain and then began immunotherapy Optiva and Yrvoy. They moved fast, but I think she only had her brain surgery as quickly as she did because it was life-threatening. It's been 15 months, and she's doing well, although still on the Optiva. I saw her newest scan compared with the original one recently. The bit still left in her brain is ""dead,"" her other mets are gone, and the lung mass is demonstratively smaller with none of the junk it was originally surrounded with. When it gets a bit smaller, her doctor is planning more targeted radiation. Myself however, am a completely different story. We discovered I have Stage IV colon cancer completely by accident just after I turned 40. I also landed in the ER with pain they thought at first was appendicitis; if only! That was early December, and I didn't begin treatment until February. There is no colon cancer anywhere in my family. I was super healthy. I ate well, rarely drank, didn't smoke, and regularly walked 100+ miles a month with my dog. I had absolutely no symptoms that would have caught my doctor's attention enough to call for an early colonoscopy. I did have a few small ones, but nothing abnormal for my age group that wasn't typically easily cared for, such as perhaps taking a bit more fiber for constipation. I'm almost three years on and am doing reasonably well. My scans are clear, and I find out Thursday if I can suspend my chemo again after a recurrence, so fingers crossed.I'm so sorry. My thoughts are with you and yours, and the candles are lit. My mom is similar; brain mets with small cell lung cancer. We found out a year ago the beginning of May. She had a fast growing tumor that was barely a month old but was causing immense pain. At the time, she'd been fighting to schedule spinal surgery for degenerative disk disease. She was ignoring the pain and not letting us know how bad it actually was. I live almost two hours away, so she was able to play it off over the phone, but my SIL stopped by and managed to bully my strong-willed mother to the ER, which shows how bad it was. She was placed on meds and kept under observation to control the growth, had brain surgery a couple of weeks later, and they were able to remove the vast majority of it. Apparently, it was a close thing. She didn't have a stroke, but she could have, and the doctor said if she hadn't come in when she did, she would be gone. She had several radiation sessions for her brain, got her port, and then healed a bit before beginning her immunotherapy. She was on Optivo and Yrvoy every two weeks (treatments alternated between one and both), although recently, it's just Optivo since her doctor is happy with her current scans. I was with her when he compared the very first lung scan to her most recent one. It was demonstratively smaller and had none of the original junk around it. The doctor said when it reduced by half? (can't recall exactly) again, he would do targeted radiation. The tiny bit left in her head is still dead and not growing, and the other mets are gone.",395,0,0,"['start', 'im', 'sorry', 'thoughts', 'this', 'normal', 'although', 'i', 'know', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'waiting', 'first', 'just', 'mother', 'support', 'well', 'possible', 'ensure', 'someone', 'act', 'scribe', 'appointments', 'dont', 'bother', 'dr', 'google', 'you', 'dont', 'enough', 'info', 'youll', 'overwhelm', 'numbers', 'i', 'speak', 'sides', 'fence', 'my', 'mother', 'stage', 'iv', 'small', 'cell', 'found', 'completely', 'accident', 'early', 'last', 'year', 'metastasized', 'brain', 'landed', 'er', 'she', 'symptoms', 'we', 'werent', 'shocked', 'per', 'se', 'cancer', 'since', 'shes', 'smoked', '50', 'years', 'grandmother', 'also', 'lung', 'cancer', 'what', 'shocked', 'late', 'stage', 'discernible', 'symptoms', 'she', 'brain', 'surgery', 'radiation', 'treat', 'left', 'brain', 'began', 'immunotherapy', 'optiva', 'yrvoy', 'they', 'moved', 'fast', 'i', 'think', 'brain', 'surgery', 'quickly', 'lifethreatening', 'its', '15', 'months', 'shes', 'well', 'although', 'still', 'optiva', 'i', 'saw', 'newest', 'scan', 'compared', 'original', 'one', 'recently', 'the', 'bit', 'still', 'left', 'brain', 'dead', 'mets', 'gone', 'lung', 'mass', 'demonstratively', 'smaller', 'none', 'junk', 'originally', 'surrounded', 'when', 'gets', 'bit', 'smaller', 'doctor', 'planning', 'targeted', 'radiation', 'myself', 'however', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'we', 'discovered', 'i', 'stage', 'iv', 'colon', 'cancer', 'completely', 'accident', 'i', 'turned', '40', 'i', 'also', 'landed', 'er', 'pain', 'thought', 'first', 'appendicitis', 'that', 'early', 'december', 'i', 'didnt', 'begin', 'treatment', 'february', 'there', 'colon', 'cancer', 'anywhere', 'family', 'i', 'super', 'healthy', 'i', 'ate', 'well', 'rarely', 'drank', 'didnt', 'smoke', 'regularly', 'walked', '100', 'miles', 'month', 'dog', 'i', 'absolutely', 'symptoms', 'would', 'caught', 'doctors', 'attention', 'enough', 'call', 'early', 'colonoscopy', 'i', 'small', 'ones', 'nothing', 'abnormal', 'age', 'group', 'wasnt', 'typically', 'easily', 'cared', 'perhaps', 'taking', 'bit', 'fiber', 'constipation', 'im', 'almost', 'three', 'years', 'reasonably', 'well', 'my', 'scans', 'clear', 'i', 'find', 'thursday', 'i', 'suspend', 'chemo', 'recurrence', 'fingers', 'crossedim', 'sorry', 'my', 'thoughts', 'candles', 'lit', 'my', 'mom', 'similar', 'brain', 'mets', 'small', 'cell', 'lung', 'cancer', 'we', 'found', 'year', 'ago', 'beginning', 'may', 'she', 'fast', 'growing', 'tumor', 'barely', 'month', 'old', 'causing', 'immense', 'pain', 'at', 'time', 'shed', 'fighting', 'schedule', 'spinal', 'surgery', 'degenerative', 'disk', 'disease', 'she', 'ignoring', 'pain', 'letting', 'us', 'know', 'bad', 'actually', 'i', 'live', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'away', 'able', 'play', 'phone', 'sil', 'stopped', 'managed', 'bully', 'strongwilled', 'mother', 'er', 'shows', 'bad', 'she', 'placed', 'meds', 'kept', 'observation', 'control', 'growth', 'brain', 'surgery', 'couple', 'weeks', 'later', 'able', 'remove', 'vast', 'majority', 'apparently', 'close', 'thing', 'she', 'didnt', 'stroke', 'could', 'doctor', 'said', 'hadnt', 'come', 'would', 'gone', 'she', 'several', 'radiation', 'sessions', 'brain', 'got', 'port', 'healed', 'bit', 'beginning', 'immunotherapy', 'she', 'optivo', 'yrvoy', 'every', 'two', 'weeks', 'treatments', 'alternated', 'one', 'although', 'recently', 'optivo', 'since', 'doctor', 'happy', 'current', 'scans', 'i', 'compared', 'first', 'lung', 'scan', 'recent', 'one', 'it', 'demonstratively', 'smaller', 'none', 'original', 'junk', 'around', 'the', 'doctor', 'said', 'reduced', 'half', 'cant', 'recall', 'exactly', 'would', 'targeted', 'radiation', 'the', 'tiny', 'bit', 'left', 'head', 'still', 'dead', 'growing', 'mets', 'gone', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,"['pain', 'chronic constipation']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Chemotherapy', 'Targeted Therapy', 'Radiation Therapy']",carcinoma

Have you considered asking an actual doctor and not being ridiculous on a sub for diagnosed patients??I think this must be an allergic reaction to the bandage - I had plenty to certain types of adhesive and I can’t imagine how much more sensitive a little baby’s skin would be! Poor thing. I’d take him in to be seen and have a derm consult. They’ll probably give him a bit of steroid to calm things down.I ate a load of instant ramen! It’s a good hospital snack because you just need hot water and it’s calorie dense. I ate a lot of cheese (like fondue type stuff) and milkshakes because they’re easy to get down- i also second the pizza suggestion. Soup is easy to get down and can be made more calorie dense by adding powdered milk. I’d also speak to your dietician in hospital to help support your nutrition and get food you like better. Day four is very early on so I’d hang in there. Be prepared for methotrexate mouth sores. Sometimes you can access a “special or cultural menu”- as I was vegetarian I had extra options from the Asian and Caribbean menu at my hospital in the UK which are more spiced and seasoned. I also liked the cancer cookbook by Rebecca Katz. She’s a chef whose father had cancer and she adapted lots of recipes to be extra nutritious and palatable to patients. Some are free online too. I especially liked the mineral broth.Does she have a robust anti nausea regimen? Is she taking her current meds round the clock at exact intervals? Does she have multiple types of anti nausea meds working at once? Have you checked to see if she may have bad acidity because of chemo, as this can cause horrible nausea too? If the answer to any of these is NO then she needs to sort that out first with her medical team. Weed is fine but it’s not some kind of magic drug that necessarily works any better than conventional medicines for nausea.Totally get this and had ALL myself, but acute blood cancers are a totally different treatment protocol than any solid tumour I am aware of, so our routes into chemo are usually by default way way quicker than most other patients.

It’s going to take time, in fact, it’s going to take years until cancer begins to move to the back burner for you.

Just remember, take it day by day. You’ve come out the other side of something absolutely life altering.

803,charlie1701,"OP, I'm sorry to hear you and your fiancé are in this situation. I started dating my partner just after his terminal diagnosis. He had a good quality of life for much longer than expected but passed away in June. We made a lot of happy memories together and got really good at communicating. I started therapy a year into his treatment and highly recommend it. I needed somewhere to dump my feelings so I could be there for him. Even though he was terminal, nothing went as expected. We made plans, travelled and enjoyed our extra time together as long as we were able. Having lots of photos, voice messages, videos and our cat helps me now. It is tough, no question.

805,chellychelle711,"For me, even when I tell my loved ones about my constant issues and diagnoses I say it will be ok. Because for me, it means that whatever decision or event happens it just is. I have no control outside of my decisions and this horrible rare genetic disease with no cure, my post stem cell transplant issues and my other diagnoses which do not have cures, are part of my circle of life (not to be cheesy). The end will come when it’s time. And then peace. Time continues on, the world keeps spinning but after losing my mom and my BFF both to cancer I know this to be true - it will be ok. The sun will set on that day and will rise to start anew for those who continue on. Sending love to your family 💜I just shutdown any communication with that person. By saying I’ll check with my doctor, she might be thinking she’s got the in. My family is ridiculous and I had to ignore whatever communication and let my dad know his brother or SIL is out of bounds and tell her to knock it off. This was specifically my aunt. I’ve had some of my very best friends suggest crap like alkaline water and I just stopped communicating. These are the same ones who don’t care that I need everyone around me vaccinated and not at risk to give me something while I’m immunocompromised. They think well they don’t mean me because I’m related or close and disregard. I still don’t have the desire to put any energy into anyone who’s doing this crap. You only have so much a day and there are better things to spend it on especially just doing for yourself. It’s just noise and you don’t have to be nice and courteous all the time just because you love them. It sounds rough but boundaries are super important. If needed an onc psychiatrist or therapist is also a great neutral ear to help you deal and get through this. Best wishesNope it doesn’t matter less! It hurts just as much like everyone else. I lost my mom to cancer in 2008 and in 2018 when I was diagnosed with an inherited rare genetic disorder and cancer, my dad just went on with his life. Always aloof and loves to act like it’s happening to him for drama. Cancer exposes all the cracks and dismantles the facade. It requires you to build boundaries and protect yourself. It is not selfish, it’s a way to maintain your life without being disrespected after all you went through went through. Narcissistic people assume it’s all over and you can go back to feeding their self. It’s a bucket that will never fill and the silent treatment is the rudest thing you can do to someone you “love”. It’s always on their terms and now you know what you need for yours. You don’t have to return the disrespect but you can love from afar. It is exhausting to keep up communication if you’re always the one who gets the raw end of the deal. It’s not hate, it’s the inability to use coping skills and some have some empathy. There may be some part of them that doesn’t want to deal with the possibility of losing you. And they don’t have the coping skill level to deal with it. Part of it is that things like this were never discussed. Gen X, we raised ourselves. However it’s their problem to deal with and they do not need to bring their fear and worry to you. They think what they’ve done is enough and all they can possibly handle. We can do hard things but people don’t like to be uncomfortable regardless of the situation. Lean into your friends. Ask them if they would with specific things on your calendar so they can plan ahead. Quick errands, help with housework cuz you’re not to lift much and just some couch cuddle time. You’re still a mom and your children expect you to show up and you need to identify the people in your life that show up for you. Ask your team for a referral to an onc psychiatrist or therapist that can help you through these times. It really helped me to have a neutral ear to listen and give feedback. How do you cope with this going forward? How do you make your life in survivorship? Couples therapy with your husband. Therapy with your children who need to get the fear feelings off their chest and be comforted. You are probably not going to change your parents habits or the way they do and don’t communicate. You have to learn to let go of things not in your control. A therapist can help with how you put you above everyone else. It’s a change for sure. Learn how to build healthy boundaries and maintain them. You can’t compare any other treatment or journey to yours. What happened in the past is done. We only move forward day by day and make adjustments as needed. You don’t need to forgive and forget but you have to release the energy it holds in you. Scream. Shimmy. Throw something. Get it out and close that door. When you know better, you do better. Don’t expect anything from anyone except for what you’ve asked for from people you trust. It’s really heard because your heart has all the feels for your parents and siblings. It sucks. All of it sucks. Losing physical parts of your body. Chemo. Everything. Last of all - give yourself some grace for getting to where you are. It’s a lot of work and no one knows except those who have been there. Pat yourself on the back for the things you can do and ask for help for the ones you can’t. Celebrate small victories! Have the cake! Take careI am so sorry that you have already been through a lot in your life. You cannot change what is in the past and you are in charge of everything going forward. First, you didn’t do anything to get this, no one deserves this, the shit just mutates. There’s no one to blame or be mad at. I inherited my gene mutation from my mom and my siblings didn’t. I was diagnosed with MDS/bone marrow failure at 45. You can be angry at cancer and will go through lots of emotions. There will be a social worker to help you with logistics and finances if needed. Seeing a therapist to help you deal and cope really helps. Check out LLS.org for all the info you may need. They are very helpful and have lots of resources including financial help. Super friendly on the phone too. You are not alone, you now have a whole community around you. The whole situation is shit. So now you know that your body is sick. You will feel fatigued and groggy until they start killing it. You may get blood or other blood products to keep your levels up. You can take naps and conserve your energy. You may have breathless moments when your blood volume is low. Eat a high protein diet and work to stop smoking. You can have edibles if it’s legal in your state. And you’ll need to consider staying a bit quarantined so you don’t catch anything while out and about. Any illness could make you very sick. You don’t want anything to delay your next steps. The current covid strains are pretty easy to pick up. You will want your body in the best shape (rested, fed, hydrated) going into treatment if you choose treatment. You always have choices on this journey and deciding whether you get treatment or not is the big ones. You are very young and this is a marathon but you are always in control. Don’t listen to any snake oil or crackpot advice. Alkaline water or magnets or some special oil or a retreat in Mexico will not kill the cancer. There’s only one way and that’s to blast the hell out of it with chemo and other treatments as directed by your doctor. Even since I had chemo and my stem cell transplant almost 6 years ago, the treatments and advancements in blood cancer have been significant. You have the cancer now, so quitting sugar or going vegan or exercising profusely won’t help. Quitting smoking or moving to a patch to get off will be vital to your recovery because nicotine constricts the blood vessels and you need all the blood you have flowing freely. We don’t compare our cancer journeys. No one’s is more or less than yours. It is a unique experience because of your DNA. Your team will suggest a treatment plan that is specifically designed for you. Again, you didn’t do anything for this to happen. There is always help to be found. Ping me if you have any questions. The Leukemia forum is great too once you learn more. Take care 💜First congrats on your transplant! You have a bumpy 2-3 weeks ahead of you so right now, eat as much as you can because you won’t want anything during engraftment. High protein, high calorie is the goal of each meal and you will be on the neutropenic diet until day 100 or when your team gives you the ok. This is just one part of the journey where you don’t make the rules so it’s really just looking at it as temporary. Mind over matter. Your body needs a lot of fuel to get you through to the other side. It’s got to completely rebuild your body. Feed it, help it do its job. The diet is no fun and your taste will be off for quite awhile so eating for enjoyment will have to come later. Use plastic utensils. Add peanut butter to everything especially. Grilled cheese sandwiches. Beef stew or other stews full of lentils and beans. Shakes either premade or made with a protein powder added to it. Stay away from spicy and acidic foods fo the time being. Your mouth and GI will thank you. Mac & cheese since you can do noodles. Whatever it is, add protein to the meal. And you don’t have to have 3 meals a day. Break them down into smaller snack size meals and time them with meds or before you walk. Get a schedule together so your fueling throughout the day. This is the part that sucks but it’s what you get through to the rest of your life.

810,cllittlewood,"I am late to comment, but I did a Reddit search to see if there is anyone else out there like me (42 F). I too have never met another adult survivor of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. I am a survivor of Stage IIB (intermediate risk) embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the soft palate- mets to my tonsils. I was 15 yo at the time of my diagnosis in 1997 and was treated at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I’ve struggled with survivors guilt as well… still do. I wonder where the friends that I made would be today. One way that I’ve helped myself find peace and accept what I cannot change is by participating in research studies when they present to me. I’ve struggled with chronic health conditions that are a result of the chemo and XRT that I received, as well as secondary cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, age 35). My genetic testing did not reveal a genetic mutation that would predispose me to cancer. I lost my Mother to ovarian cancer when she was 49.

812,coffee_riot_148,"Stage 4 lung cancer here. Had a melanoma on my toe and that digit got hacked off but not before the cells traveled into my lungs. Now I have a mass the size of a kiwi fruit and some smaller nodules too. Starting immunotherapy on Wednesday. I'm being treated at Virginia Commonwealth University's Massey Cancer Center and they're keeping me positive. My oncologist is very professional and never gave me a vibe of doom. Chemo kind of freaked me out because it's basically a poison. Immunotherapy was the only recommended therapy (for the time being) because it's a drug that boosts your own immune system into hyperdrive.It's one IV that takes 30 minutes and it's a monthly dose. I'm 51, so maybe age and health is a factor, but doc said after some time and constant monitoring adjustments can be made and there are clinical studies I could enter. At no time did my team tell me how bad it is, nor my chance of survival, or a time period left to live and I like it that way. Since Day 1 of my diagnosis (June 17) I'VE held onto the PMA (positive mental outlook). That's all I can do under the circumstances. My only advice for you while your father undergoes this cancer shit-show is to reach out to him, tell him you love him all the time and make him talk about his feelings, Try to carve out a bit of time here and there.

813,colbsk1,"First, I want to express how deeply sorry I am for what you and your wife are going through. She is incredibly fortunate to have your support during this time. What you're experiencing reminds me of the last 77 days of my mother's life. She was diagnosed with small cell carcinoma in May of 2024 and passed away on August 10th 2024. Her cancer was extremely aggressive, partly due to her heavy smoking and drinking. Despite the installation of a chemo port, she chose not to undergo chemotherapy, opting instead to avoid the side effects and spend her remaining days with some semblance of quality. In her final days: On August 8th, around 2:30 p.m., my mother decided to lie down for a nap. That was the last time she got out of bed. She was still eating, talking, and using the bathroom, but as the week progressed, she ate less, spoke less, and slept more. On August 10th, her final day, my dad reported that at 1:30 a.m., my mom woke him by hitting him and said, ""Let's go."" When he asked where, she didn’t respond, and they both went back to sleep. It seemed to me that this was a brief burst of energy before her final moments. In her last hours: At 4:30 a.m. on August 10th, my dad was awakened by labored breathing followed by the death rattle. By 6:45 a.m., she was grinding her teeth, a sign of possible pain, so she was given morphine. Her eyes were half-open, without movement, and her pupils were unresponsive to light. When I arrived around 10:15 a.m., she appeared lifeless, though her chest still rose and fell weakly. The sound of mucus and saliva with her shallow breaths was unsettling. Her legs were purple, her feet moved sporadically, and her eyes were glassy. I tried to get a response by making eye contact, squeezing her hand, and tickling her feet, but there was no reaction. I did manage to get a slight groan when I massaged her shoulder. Holding her hand, it grew cold rapidly. I left briefly to speak with my dad, and upon returning, I found her chest no longer moving and the rattling sound had stopped. It was clear that she had passed away. The time was 3:15p.m., the same time I was born oddly enough. I hope sharing this helps in some way. If not, that's okay too. Writing about it has been a form of solace for me, as I don’t keep a diary or journal. Keep fighting, and know that my thoughts are with you and your wife.

It would have meant so much to hear “I love you and I’m here for you no matter what” You are a WONDERFUL friend!!!!It’s was rough. My wife and I had a lot of trouble. Almost 2 years of me being sick, scared, anger, non-functional genitals, extreme anxiety, no support system (we had just moved out of state 3 months before diagnosis), and my job let me go, so we ended up broke, financially stressed, and thankfully on Medicaid (which was great insurance by the way !). It was difficult for us to find “us” again. We were guided by a therapist to write down our honest reflections of the experience and share / process them. It was a long hard (HARD!) time, but we both came out of the process feeling connected again. Believe it or not, I hadn’t realized how much she struggled too. Admittedly, I was just surviving, but I hadn’t realized how much trauma she felt too. There was so much we didn’t understand about each other’s experience. Things were tentative for a while, and we kinda had to re-learn each other because we both have been changed. I’m just now starting to try and work again. I had a job early in my recovery, but the panic attacks and numerous dr appointments made it awkward and untenable.

817,currutia914,Here just to comment on what I’ve seen other moms do. I run an end of life consulting company where we talk about legacy items. Notes or cards for all major life events - handwritten if possible. Recorded voice readings of any children books. Especially holiday ones. Lullabies … For this- I really like the Yoto player cards … but also just mp3 format is good because they can be added to any playlists etc. Music playlist on Spotify The book “100 questions for mom”. It’s a fill in the blank book with prompts. The book “handwritten letters to my son” with idea prompts. Photos. Lots of photos. Videos- even more than photos because seeing you alive and moving is important. Special token or keepsake that can go on the Christmas tree and/or be displayed. Teddy bear made out of your favorite shirts and sprayed with your signature smell. Drawings from you. I saw one mom do 500 post-it notes with little drawings to keep in a “book” that she wrote a story for. I loved this idea a lot. If you’re religious - your Bible with marked versus for them to read or if not religious a list of books that you think everyone should read. Your bucket list- even if you don’t finish the items- they may want to do them after your gone together as a way to honor you. A list of how you’d like to be remembered and celebrated.

827,dirkwoods,"Gratitude squared. Well put. I see so much suffering that seems related to the false dichotomy- ""I have cancer, I might die"" and ""if I cure the cancer I won't die"". If we start with the assumption that being born means suffering and dying then it is just about what we do with the interstitium. I am so happy for you that you woke up and are choosing gratitude and joy for the time between these realities. It is the only sane response to our mortal reality.As a retired male physician my experience is that this is an unfortunate reality that is slowly changing and doesn't have any easy answers other than what you propose- advocate for yourself and be pleasantly pushy regarding further testing (""could you humor me doc and order a MRI of my brain for focal neurological symptoms that are otherwise unexplained?""). I had a rare but potentially serious neurologic disease that is frequently disregarded for weeks to months until it progresses and looks more classic. I called my doctor and advised him that I had a symmetric polyneuropathy that was starting to ascend and I was worried about the rare possibility of GB. Even the neurologist said, ""Oh, it's real!"" after doing my testing, but I wasn't blown off for weeks to months before they scheduled the testing. My wife almost punched the Neurologist when he said that btw. When I first started having metastatic cancer symptoms I was able to convince myself that they were statistically likely to be something else- until they progressed... The problem is as a human when you do 100 tests and 99 of them are negative you come to expect negative. In Emergency Medicine because the economic and other barriers are so high we tend to come at it from a ""prove to me you are well"" instead of ""prove to me you are sick"" perspective (that comes from patients bringing 10 complaints to a previously scheduled PCP appointment none of which go to a level of concern that would make them want to part with $500 for an ER visit co-pay). We way over-tested in the ER and we could easily spend the entire gross domestic product of this country and not meet all of our citizens' medical needs. We have the worst healthcare system in the world, until you visit the other 6 continents I have practiced on. You are right to be disappointed. It doesn't sound like you have personalized this at all. Hopefully my perspective helped a tiny bit.Beautiful. I was given a 12-18 month median survival, which I took to heart. What was not embedded in those statistics is that we are in a golden era of cancer research. New lily pads keep popping up that can be utilized until ""durability"" becomes an issue. A perfect example is my brain mets with a median survival of 2-3 months- now extended to 2-3 years with a gamma knife procedure that didn't exist when I was a medical student. Another example is a silver bullet ADC chemo drug I am on that is shrinking my tumors- they have been talking about the ""silver bullet cancer drug"" that only attacks cancer cells for a century but now they are actually being used. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Figure out whether you want to do some lily pad hopping in hopes of outliving median survival (that only means half live longer and half shorter right?). We get to decide right?HPV+ HNSCC with 7 brain mets treated with gamma knife May 2024 with good follow-up MRI. Advised repeat may be needed in 2-3 years (far exceeding my median survival estimate). I said, ""where do I sign up?"". Gamma knife was a breeze for me. Hopefully the gallows humor helps you too, it does me.What does your doctor say? Follow them, PET scan, biopsy, something else? Do you have an Oncology Psychologist to help you manage the ups and downs? Difficult as it is to believe there are people out there that have done nothing but speak with cancer patients 50 hours a week for the last 20 years. They can be very helpful.Tell who you want, what you want, when you want. It gets much easier as the profound reality sinks in with you. No rush in most circumstances. You will have more info later.Common. Yesterday isn't fast enough for us, a few weeks is rushing it for providers with already overbooked schedules.

834,driftingthroughtime,"This is unfortunately an all too common story. And, it’s even more frustrating because early detection is key AND you are paying attention to your body, so know something is wrong. Are there really that many hypochondriacs going through doctors offices? But, no! Healthcare in America is terrible. We would rather spend more money on treatment than prevention because statistically it is slightly cheaper. Anyway, good luck on your journey. It’s a shitty one.Definitely get yourself a new oncologist, and insist on a full torso CT scan. Also … I get it. Treatment sucks ass. (I call it torture.) Remember that cancer is part of you and that they need to kill your healthy parts in order to get the cancer. So, there’s a push/pull situation going on treat/recover, rinse and repeat until the cancer is gone or you are. I can personally attest that the treatment works, and you can make it to the other side. But, I have found that your body never really fully recovers. Of course, it’s better than the alternative.

Do you have a partner? If not, I would ask a few good friends to check in on you. You might want to do that anyway because so much falls on your partner, your household chores especially, but don’t forget the emotional toll they carry. Talk to your oncologist and nursing staff. They will be able to help you with the side effects. And, if the side effects are harsh, they will adjust your dosage. Stay as active as you can. Is this course the first step for you?

842,emorrigan,"I understand that you’re afraid to move during treatment- it’s a terrifying prospect. But sometimes life hands us really crappy circumstances, and this sounds like one of those times. Consider that your husband might also be terrified. He didn’t choose to get laid off, and he isn’t moving for fun- he’s moving in order to be able to keep you and your children housed, and to make sure you have insurance. The prospect of losing those things while you’re still in treatment must be absolutely terrifying for him. California is extremely expensive- just “any job” won’t cut it, both monetarily and insurance-wise. You’ve unfortunately got to be pragmatic here and go where the money and health insurance are. And even that isn’t the end of the line- my sister lives in Utah, and her insurance covered treatment in Texas. You and your husband need to work with his new company’s HR Department to see who your new health insurance provider will be, and then you can work with your current doctors as well as the new insurance provider to see if treatment will be covered. I’m sorry you’re in this situation- it sounds like a difficult one… but unfortunately at this point, you need to go where the money is. Your husband has found a way for your family to remain housed and insured.

844,erinmarie777,"That’s very good advice and thank you for sharing your experience. It’s very understandable why you feel angry. I have distrust in many doctors myself. I’m sorry you have to experience such a traumatic disease. I’m glad you feel hopeful with the immunotherapy, and hope it smacks down all the pests. Sending healing thoughts. I’m angry for all the people who have been told not to worry about it when their bodies were giving them so many signals, and then turned out that they had cancer. There’s so many young people who have made videos about this story of being ignored, even for years, and then finally getting diagnosed. Why do doctors think they are so good at psychology? It makes me angry. They should do more tests but they don’t want to beg the insurance for “approval” because it’s so time consuming. I’ve heard them discussing this. So instead they seem to like to tell too many people that it’s all in their heads. Women get told that far too often. And black women are more likely to be ignored and die after childbirth because their complaints are ignored too often. We need to work harder on making this world a better place for everyone. It’s not nice sometimes in ways that are definitely wrong, but also just very unnecessary. Doctors need more time with patients and need to be allowed to do more testing. It shouldn’t take years to get an MRI when people have significant problems, they don’t know what it is causing it, but nothing works. I think we need more diagnostic specialists who can help people with finding out what is going wrong with them. Let’s get rid of insurance companies dictating how much time doctors can take and what tests they can do. Maybe the business model is corrupted too. Maybe they just want us coming back several times before ordering tests.No such thing when it’s cancer. xThat was a good question. You have gone through so much. I have always wondered what the trigger was the first time people sought medical attention. From what I’ve seen, people wait and see, and don’t go to a doctor unless they feel like they really have to.I know you don’t really want to discuss your marriage here, but I do feel shocked she actually said she didn’t care about your scan or your scan anxiety and then she had such a non-response to the news of the spot. That behavior suggests that she’s resentful about something that she hasn’t verbally expressed yet? I don’t know. I just hope she can look within herself and figure herself out and open up about why she wasn’t feeling empathetic to your emotions. You certainly deserve empathy and support. It’s so hard and so stressful to worry about it. Take a deep breath and tell yourself you will “wait and see”. Worry won’t help you, but I am so sorry you may have to beat back cancer again. I really hope they are wrong.I think saying “everything will be okay” is something that can feel comforting at times even when it’s probably not true. I’m so sorry for your son and you and your family. Maybe because your son was already thinking about stopping treatment, in some ways, he will take this as his permission to just enjoy the rest of his life as long as he can. Idk. It’s so hard for me to know what to say to you. I’m just very sorry that you have been given such bad news and have to tell him this awful news.If you don’t want to hurt her feelings, you can say you will look at it later, but right now what you need most from her is to please talk about anything else to distract you because you need a break. Then change the subject by asking about her family, her activities, her feelings, etc. Hopefully she will want to support you by respecting your needs.My heart really hurts for you and for all the cancer patients who haven’t been supported like they all need and deserve. I’m just blown away sometimes by how some parents treat their grown children. I rcan’t stop thinking about my own grown children or my grandchildren. Their health and happiness means the world to me. I always try to help in ways I can and as much as I can because I know how hard life can be, and I brought them into this life. Parents need to understand how important they are to their children, and how that continues long after they are grown. I always wonder how these uncaring neglectful parents were raised. What were their childhoods like? In my case I was very neglected as a child. My mother never expressed love or affection. She really rarely spoke. I got a hug from her for the first time in my life when I was 30. She hugged me and said “take care of yourself” when I was leaving (after I paid her a rare visit). I trembled for an hour. I know that both my parents came from large families and were children in the Great Depression. Their parents had no time for them, both working constantly. Still not enough to go around. My parents were both moody and angry people who never healed from their bad childhood and were never healthy as adults. My dad became an angry abusive “functioning alcoholic” who cheated on my mom, and my mom was chronically anxious and depressed. When I was growing up, I vowed that I would shower my children with love and affection, and help them every way I could. As an adult I have worked hard to process my past, and to heal. I believe “Know Thyself” is the best advice for anyone. It is so important to be aware and mindful of your own weaknesses and strengths and where they come from, and to work on yourself every day. We can’t always control our emotions but we can control our actions. Whether you speak to your parents again or not, seek healing, find some kind of understanding if possible, and work towards being at peace within yourself. The most important thing is not to pass your unhealed pain from your wounds onto the next generation. Gabor Mate has some good books and interviews about healing from childhood trauma on YouTube. I’m so glad they caught your cancer early and you have a good chance to reach remission. Can’t tell you how much I wish that was true for my son. He has glioblastoma and it’s the worst nightmare to worry about his chances for survival for 5 years.I feel so sorry for people who are dating these days. I’ve heard so many crazy stories about guys who start out okay but turn into complete weirdos on dates. But dating after being diagnosed with cancer might be a real trip for you I’m afraid. Even friends and family can say the wrong things and give ridiculous advice sometimes. I love your self confidence. Keep smiling. Keep venting your experiences. I hope you don’t meet too many more toads before you find someone who was raised well and can become a trustworthy best friend and a real supporter for you. You deserve that. Everyone does.Writing about this experience might be therapeutic for you to help you process your emotions. I think your fiancé, family, and friends would appreciate it when you’re gone. (You could also make videos for them). My son has an incurable cancer and he recommended a book called “The Last Lecture”. It was written by a professor who was terminally ill. He has since passed. My son is a philosophy professor and he has been studying the philosophy of “Stocism” and says it’s helpful for him. I have also found reading about Stocism helpful for myself. I am struggling with accepting this terrible reality that I am losing my first child. I’m just trying to remember that when we’re born, no one ever knows when they are going to die or how they will die. The only thing that is certain about life is that everyone does die. We are just pretending that everyone gets to live a long life because most of us live in too much denial to face the reality that it can happen any time and any day. We need to work harder on that in our culture. We have too much denial about a lot of issues. My heart goes out to you. I’m so sorry. You are so young.

852,feathernose,"I’m so sorry.. i went through excruciating pain from tumors in my spine too, it’s the worst pain i’ve ever felt and also felt i couldn’t live long with that kind of pain. Is it possible for you to find another oncologist? Second time radiation is sometimes possible, as well as another chemo, and surgery. It took me 3 surgeries (because it grew back) and maybe more in the future. There have to be doctors willing to look out of the box and willing to help you. There are also medications for these kinds of pain. Your doctors should really be more helpful. Please stand up for yourself and do everything you can! Sometimes doctors need a reality check. It took me initially years before my GP took my pain seriously. They were almost too late. Please look out for yourself. And seek for help <3 maybe all hope is not lost.Oh is it like ‘eat a dozen of apricot seeds a day’ or ‘take a vitamin C overdose daily’? If yes, are we family?Good point. I do believe your ‘healthcare team’ aka your doctors, should come up with a plan to make sure you have the best quality of life as possible. This should possibly include counseling, help to keep your house clean and livable, medications to ease any pain or discomfort.. this last stage in life should be as comfortable as possible. Do you have friends and family around that can help? I believe it might difficult to reach out to your doctors and friends and family, but please do it. You deserve the best. Do not worry about being a burden (apologies for the possible assumption, i receive palliative care and i do feel like a burden but i hope you feel better), it’s important to receive love and care. I really hope you will enjoy life to the fullest while it lasts. And i genuinely hope you’re in not too much pain. Big hugs from a stranger on the internet! 🫂At first, the stress really got to him. And me. It was very hard. He didnt choose to be with someone who has cancer, right? We had our issues but every time we pushed on through. He took care of me. I took care of him whenever i had tiny bit of energy left. We had 1 or 2 moments where we almost broke up. It was hard for both of us. It was 6 years ago - after treatment the cancer came back 2 years later. Treatment again. Guess what? 2 years later the cancer came back AGAIN. Finished surgery and chemo a few months ago. Its still hard sometimes because the relationship feels unbalanced because he has much more energy than me. But he is okay with that. He takes care for me and before my chemo he told me he really wanted to fight this battle together as a team. So it took us some years to find a way to manage our lives together and still be happy and have fun together. We now focus on the good moments together, building a lot of good memories. If you wanna talk i'm here for you.No new perspective on life, sorry. When my cancer got malignant i was 28 and i’m 34 now and finished my 12th chemo (after 3 surgeries and 30 rounds of radiation) a few months ago. Sadly no, it did not gave me a new perspective on life, apart from the fact i need to sign a will, for when the cancer kills me. Dating? That has been very very hard. Maybe because my self esteem is crap after all treatments because my body looks like a 50 year old, but maybe because guys just don’t want to date a woman with cancer. I don’t know. I don’t want to discourage you. Live your life, do what makes your happy, date if you have any libido left, do everything you want. This is the only life you get <3I know how you feel. My last chemo was in march, and i’m just starting to feel better now, for a bit. I’ve been pretty depressed because the chemo did more to my body than i thought. Good chance I’m infertile at age 34 now. My hormones not balanced. You don’t have to be happy, cancer sucks and youbhave the right to feel shitty about it even after finishing your last round of chemo. Chances of recurrence are always there and you will have to carry that with you. But you will find a way to manage. Keep yourself busy, do things that make you happy.

856,frostbike,"Great info in this comment. I was diagnosed last year and started chemo after my biopsy confirmed it was cancer but before we had the genetic testing results. The genetic tests revealed that I have an ALK mutation (similar to the EGFR mentioned) and I started taking alectinib. Chemo did nothing to stop my progression, but alectinib has been wonderful. So definitely make sure they do the genetic testing. Also, I very much agree with the recommendation not to read survival stats online. For the first six months or so I only used google to look up words and concepts I didn’t understand from radiology reports and doctor visits.Great news!As others have said, get the biomarker testing done. I was diagnosed last fall, stage 4 with mets in multiple bones and lymph nodes. Within a couple months of the diagnosis I lost 25 pounds, couldn’t walk without a cane (and a lot of pain), and my main tumor grew so fast it was pressing against the blood vessels that supply my heart, which resulted in a 3 day hospital stay. I have an ALK mutation, and have been doing targeted therapy for 8 months. I can walk and do most daily activities now.

867,gtzbr478,"I'm so very sorry... that loss of trust in medical personnel is always a big blow, I see it so much in rare disease advocacy. It doesn't mean they're ""all bad"" or one can ""never"" trust a care team, but it does mean it's important to stay informed and know the professionals do make mistakes.I also know how difficult it is to be a squeaky wheel... and how it's even more difficult when it's not your decision (like when it's your mom who has to ask for more info, for example). I hope you can find a way to get palliative care at home for your mom. Sending hugsI just wanted to say hang in there 🫶My deepest condolences 🕊️Very sorry for your loss 🫶Hugs 🫂Because it’s a second rate hospital and the scans are being done in another, in a system that still uses fax, in Quebec where the healthcare system is crumbling. One of the main oncology centre in Montreal is sending 10 chemo patients a day to another hospital as they had to close due to staff shortage (no idea what happens to the other patients, other hospitals I hope).Thank you 🫶In Canada. She could try to go somewhere else, but she doesn’t want to. I think she prefers to think the doc is right not to be worried than to go through the stress of going somewhere else and worrying that it’s necessary. I’m trying to nudge her (without my info she might not even have had the May scan and wouldn’t get this next one)… but moving hospitals isn’t in the cards yet. She’ll have to really feel they make her worse first, sadly. And now I must admit I’m not that sure she could get in, as the healthcare system is crumbling, units are closing, docs often don’t take new patients, especially if they’re already taken care of (no matter the quality of care). She possibly would face months of wait… if even possible.You are very strong and it’s so young to have to go through all you’ve gone through.

Similar to baby formula or protein milkshakes. They don't have much of a taste, some flavors like strawberry, banana or vanilla. Good luck with your dad's treatment.My heart goes out to you. I have been through pretty much the same, my dad had stage 4 lung cancer and doctors told me he has 6 months to a year left to live. His appetite was good until the last week, he had trouble breathing and standing for a minute was hard for him. He had taken two rounds of chemo but never had nausea or lost his appetite. On his last week, he started to get nausea and he threw up everything he ate. On a Friday, he went into ICU, they told me I couldn't see him until Monday due to not having enough personnel on call for weekends, and at 3am on Monday the hospital called me. Till that call, I still had hoped to see him on Monday. My advice to you is, Just stay with her. You may never be able to guess the time so spend as much time as you can with her. I'm sorry you are going through this.Mom(65) had the same surgery, she had problems with her kidneys so all pain relief they gave her was some paracetamol. After the surgery, she walked a lot on the hospital corridors, her doctors told her to blow baloons and cough a lot to expand her lungs and prevent liquid built up in her lungs. She had a slight break on one of her ribs and powered through with only Paracetamol. She had x-rays twice a day to examine the lung capacity. Everything went OK and she was sent home in 5 days. She had 3 sessions of preventative chemo. They monitor her now every 3 months with CT scans and MRIs.Her lung have expanded beautifully, and she has less problem breathing and more energy now that she had to quit smoking.

869,hey_luh,"I am so sorry for your mom. I think you need to be prepared for losing her. It's not easy, but it will bring you comfort. You should study palliative care also. Palliative care is for terminal patients, it helps to manage their pain. Because even when there is no treatment available, there is something to do: we can manage their pain and try treatments for the tumor don't grow anymore. When we don't have much experience with cancer we are used to think that stage 4 is the end, but even in the end there is plenty of things to do. Some patients even with mets can live to 3 years. I have seen one that even wrote a book ! She had mets in the liver, terminal cancer, and did dance classes. Besides that, nowadays palliative care is recommended to everyone who has a disease that threatens the life, even when it's still treatment available. Palliative care helps us to understand death and how to bring comfort for our loved ones. They teach us how to manage the physical pain of our loved ones, how to prepare them and how to enjoy every minute that we have left. I know it's hard but you have to try. Don't cancel your flight. She will need you there. A lot of patients said that they don't want their families, because they are afraid of family gets desperate and make things worst. But deep down, they need their family. Also, if you can, go see her now. She may be going, but even when we are going, there is plenty things to do. You can talk to her, you can watch movies with her and do little things that she likes. Try to act normal around her. Make her smile. I think that studying palliative care will help you a lot to understand what to do and how to manage the situation with your mother. (it helps me with my dad, he has mets in his lungs) This book ""Death is a day that worth living"" helped me a lot. I hope it will help you too.I am so sorry for your lost. My dad is in treatment for 5 years. Now he has a lot of mets, and I am his care giver too. He's not dead, but day after day he gets worse and I know that it's time to say goodbye. I didn't have family to help me (only my mom who does not get along with my dad), my friends all disappeared because I was not fun anymore and no one wants to talk about death. People avoid thinking about death, because they think that avoiding this death doesn't exist. So I think I understand how you must be felling (I don't have anyone, just my mom). I know it's hard, specially when we are alone. Our parents are our best friends (my dad is my whole world, and I think your mother it was your whole world too). And no one wants to live without our best friends. Life looses its colors, specially when we are young (I am 22, so l get it how you must be feeling). But something that I've learned studying palliative care all those years is that we never lost the one we loved. Even when they are not here, they will always be in our heart and in our memories. Our parents literally made us, they are in our DNA, they are in our qualities and also in our defaults.Your mother may be not be here physically, but she is inside you. You are her legacy. And you should live to pass forward her qualities, to be a strong and amazing human being. Don't be the person who thinks that now that your person is gone, everything is over. It's not. Your mother is still alive in your heart and inside you. She is alive when you are strong, she will be alive when you conquer things (because everything you will conqu it's because of the qualities that she taught you). She is alive when you listen her favorite song, and when you do thinas that she likes. Thinking this wav helps me a lot with my dad. I know that when he goes, he will always be inside me. He will be inside me when I watch car races (because he always loved car races). He is inside me when I learn Italian (he always wanted to learn how to speak Italian), when I listen 80's songs (He always loved 80's band, and I listen them all the time) and when I persist in my goals (he created me to be fighter and not the person who just does not have an opinion). Doing things that he likes, breathing the air that he wanted me to breathe, help me to realize that he will always live inside me. Maybe this will help you to keep your mom always around. I also learn in palliative care that when your person dies, your life will never be the same, but this doesn't mean that will always be unhappy. because that is not what our loved ones would want. Your mother would want that you would be happy. That you would go back to school and made your life, build new projects (a career, or having a family). That you fulfill your life with other happiness. I know it's hard to think about new projects when literally your whole world fell apart, but with time, you will rebuild your life and make an extraordinary life. You are stronger than most people. A lot of kids in your place would just give up, they couldn't stand give u school and being the care giver, but you didn't. Anc. is amazing. You will have the strength to make a new life and make your mother proud (and alive inside you). Besides that, the book Death is a day worths living, helped me a lot. I think you should read, and try counseling, grief therapy (individual or in group) it's helpful too. Talking to a psychologist helps you to understand your grief and move on with your life. If you need someone to talk to, please feel free to send me a DM.",537,0,0,"['start', 'i', 'sorry', 'mom', 'i', 'think', 'need', 'prepared', 'losing', 'its', 'easy', 'bring', 'comfort', 'you',

874,iSheree,"First of all, I am sorry that you're dealing with this. Second of all, you do not need to or want to go to a psych ward unless you're a danger to yourself and/or others. And thirdly, it is normal, whatever you are feeling. Just try and let it come and go in waves. Just breathe. Hugs. Since the cancer is contained to the uterus, you probably will only need the hysterectomy right? 20% or 1 in 5 women have had a hysterectomy by your age. I think you will be just fine. Just have to take care of yourself and your mental health. On a serious note though, I had cancer surgery last year on my neck and chest and I am having a hysterectomy soon at 33 years old (for gyno issues) and I can't imagine living alone going through these surgeries. Is there anyone that can help you after your surgery? Can you go stay with someone just while you recover?I was already chronically unwell before all this. I was born disabled and sick. Have developed autoimmune and cancer since then. That being said, the surgery to remove my thyroid and numerous cancerous masses from my neck and chest and the radiation treatment definitely made me worse in general. Living without a vital organ such as the thyroid is harder than I thought it would be. I haven't had chemo as my cancer does not respond to chemo so I can't really help there. I am not in remission yet, and may never be, but I am hopeful. I will never know if it's the cancer, treatment or autoimmune diseases that are making me perpetually unwell unfortunately.If you don’t want to do anymore chemo. You don’t have to. ❤️I am so sorry about your wife. You are doing very well and you are doing what a husband should be doing and thats taking care of your wife. Take care of yourself also. I don’t have a clue how long the dying process takes so I can’t help you there. It varies like you said. But I just wanted to recommend Hospice Nurse Julie on Youtube. She is great and many people wish they saw her videos before their loved ones passed away.I wonder if the treatment can still be done for quality of life purposes, even if it won't cure you. If your oncologist doesn't seem to care, then I think you need to find a new one if possible. I know it's not possible for some. I haven't got a choice in which specialists I see but I feel this is worth mentioning.I am a cancer patient and I always say everything is going to be okay. I am not offended when other people say it because their intentions are good. The truth is, even in death, everything will be okay. Death is a part of life and I believe there is more... As long as I have a roof over my head and I am safe, I am okay... It's my way of coping. I have suffered my whole life.I get this too. Skin cancer has never entered my mind.What you are experiencing is very normal. I went through this when I was first diagnosed.My partner lost his job caring for me. Unfortunately this is all too common. He was a warehouse labourer so working from home wasn't even an option. I am sorry this has happened.I don't think that applies to caregivers does it? I am not in the US so I have no idea what the ADA involves. Here in Australia, carers can do a flexible workplace agreement but employers don't like it and will find any excuse to fire you.

912,kitkatofthunder,"I’m sorry. That is really disgusting. I work with an amazing spine surgeon who is also trained in oncology. His approach is if we can’t explain something we never ignore it. Either we run more tests, imaging, or provide a referral to a specialty that might have more insight. 1. With your symptoms they should have provided you with a referral to neurology if they couldn’t find anything. 2. We can never say to anyone their symptoms are nothing. If they continue to follow-through with multiple appointments, tests, exams it means the symptoms are bothering them significantly. Each specialty has a very narrow perspective on the entirety of medicine, refer until you find it and continue follow-up to see if anything progresses, usually it doesn’t take long. 3. I hate to say it, but it doesn’t affect us at all to send for advanced imaging. It takes a few seconds for the order and if there is nothing it takes 2 minutes to read the images. If insurance fights, it sucks, but we wait 6 weeks then we send it again saying they continue to have pain and it will be approved. Denying imaging is just lazy. The only concern for imaging is sometimes we find things that are ambiguous and require further observation or tests.I’m so sorry. I have treated one patient with an active newly diagnosed pheochromocytoma and currently regularly see a second patient with pheochromocytoma in remission to evaluate for any progression of the disease. At this point in time, I can say both are alive. I say this from the perspective of orthopedic spine surgery, that being said, only 18 people in history of medical studies have had a pheochromocytoma with metastasis to the spine, so I have a very small study base to go off of when discussing treatment for patients. For patients in general, my best recommendation is going to a major facility like Sloan Kettering where the physicians actually see these things regularly. Pheochromocytoma, while rare, occur in about 0.8 in 100,000 people. There are around 333 million people in the US, these major facilities have regular interactions with these cancers. With you wanting to fight and having concerns for the experience of your physician on this particular cancer, I recommend a tertiary facility. Additionally, as you have a young son genetic testing should also be performed this cancer can be associated with some rare genetic conditions, if I had a child, I would want to make sure. While radiation can be variable with pheochromocytoma, I would have hope for chemotherapy. The 5 year survival rate for a pheochromocytoma without metastasis is 95%, while that sounds terrifying, I like to think of those as pretty good odds considering how many patients are noncompliant or have other issues. While it sucks, chemotherapy is usually much more effective than radiation, especially in the case of this particular cancer. Edited for grammar. As for discussion with patients. I have seen a patient with a cancer that we biopsied and we weren’t able to diagnose. The pathology report said it was something within the realm of an ovarian/endometrial cancer, but it wasn’t conclusive and had never been recorded before. There was a 2 hour discussion explaining how we would approach treatment with essentially no data to go off of and discussing how we would choose which treatment to approach and that we couldn’t promise or have confidence that it would work. She only came in at a late stage, and she sadly did not survive. But, because of the discussion she was able to choose to die in hospice surrounded by her family once it was clear treatment wasn’t working. While it is hard, it is sincerely important to have these conversations when we just don’t have data to back our recommendations. Thankfully, I would say this is not the case for your pheochromocytoma, while it is rare, we do have extensive medical studies performed on this cancer with n=3,000 or greater.",363,0,0,"['start', 'i', '’', 'sorry', 'that', 'really', 'disgusting', 'i', 'work', 'amazing', 'spine', 'surgeon', 'also', 'trained', 'oncology', 'his', 'approach', '’', 'explain', 'something', 'never', 'ignore', 'either', 'run', 'tests', 'imaging', 'provide', 'referral', 'specialty', 'might', 'insight', '1', 'with', 'symptoms', 'provided', 'referral', 'neurology', '’', 'find', 'anything', '2', 'we', 'never', 'say', 'anyone', 'symptoms', 'nothing', 'if', 'continue', 'followthrough', 'multiple', 'appointments', 'tests', 'exams', 'means', 'symptoms', 'bothering', 'significantly', 'each', 'specialty', 'narrow', 'perspective', 'entirety', 'medicine', 'refer', 'find', 'continue', 'followup', 'see', 'anything', 'progresses', 'usually', '’', 'take', 'long', '3', 'i', 'hate', 'say', '’', 'affect', 'us', 'send', 'advanced', 'imaging', 'it', 'takes', 'seconds', 'order', 'nothing', 'takes', '2', 'minutes', 'read', 'images', 'if', 'insurance', 'fights', 'sucks', 'wait', '6', 'weeks', 'send', 'saying', 'continue', 'pain', 'approved', 'denying', 'imaging', 'lazy', 'the', 'concern', 'imaging', 'sometimes', 'find', 'things', 'ambiguous', 'require', 'observation', 'testsi', '’', 'sorry', 'i', 'treated', 'one', 'patient', 'active', 'newly', 'diagnosed', 'pheochromocytoma', 'currently', 'regularly', 'see', 'second', 'patient', 'pheochromocytoma', 'remission', 'evaluate', 'progression', 'disease', 'at', 'point', 'time', 'i', 'say', 'alive', 'i', 'say', 'perspective', 'orthopedic', 'spine', 'surgery', 'said', '18', 'people', 'history', 'medical', 'studies', 'pheochromocytoma', 'metastasis', 'spine', 'i', 'small', 'study', 'base', 'go', 'discussing', 'treatment', 'patients', 'for', 'patients', 'general', 'best', 'recommendation', 'going', 'major', 'facility', 'like', 'sloan', 'kettering', 'physicians', 'actually', 'see', 'things', 'regularly', 'pheochromocytoma', 'rare', 'occur', '08', '100000', 'people', 'there', 'around', '333', 'million', 'people', 'us', 'major', 'facilities', 'regular', 'interactions', 'cancers', 'with', 'wanting', 'fight', 'concerns', 'experience', 'physician', 'particular', 'cancer', 'i', 'recommend', 'tertiary', 'facility', 'additionally', 'young', 'son', 'genetic', 'testing', 'also', 'performed', 'cancer', 'associated', 'rare', 'genetic', 'conditions', 'i', 'child', 'i', 'would', 'want', 'make', 'sure', 'while', 'radiation', 'variable', 'pheochromocytoma', 'i', 'would', 'hope', 'chemotherapy', 'the', '5', 'year', 'survival', 'rate', 'pheochromocytoma', 'without', 'metastasis', '95', 'sounds', 'terrifying', 'i', 'like', 'think', 'pretty', 'good', 'odds', 'considering', 'many', 'patients', 'noncompliant', 'issues', 'while', 'sucks', 'chemotherapy', 'usually', 'much', 'effective', 'radiation', 'especially', 'case', 'particular', 'cancer', 'edited', 'grammar', 'as', 'discussion', 'patients', 'i', 'seen', 'patient', 'cancer', 'biopsied', '’', 'able', 'diagnose', 'the', 'pathology', 'report', 'said', 'something', 'within', 'realm', 'ovarianendometrial', 'cancer', '’', 'conclusive', 'never', 'recorded', 'there', '2', 'hour', 'discussion', 'explaining', 'would', 'approach', 'treatment', 'essentially', 'data', 'go', 'discussing', 'would', 'choose', 'treatment', 'approach', '’', 'promise', 'confidence', 'would', 'work', 'she', 'came', 'late', 'stage', 'sadly', 'survive', 'but', 'discussion', 'able', 'choose', 'die', 'hospice', 'surrounded', 'family', 'clear', 'treatment', '’', 'working', 'while', 'hard', 'sincerely', 'important', 'conversations', '’', 'data', 'back', 'recommendations', 'thankfully', 'i', 'would', 'say', 'case', 'pheochromocytoma', 'rare', 'extensive', 'medical', 'studies', 'performed', 'cancer', 'n3000', 'greater', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Chemotherapy', 'Radiation Therapy']",Unable to specify

923,lickykicky,"I'm sorry you have to bear this. Let me try and help you here. Your wife will sleep more and be less active, as you're seeing. Over time, she will eat less and less until she's down to only tiny amounts. Don't fight it; her body knows what to do. She may need support from hospice to manage any troublesome symptoms, but there's no reason for her to be uncomfortable in any way. She might stay in this phase for some time. At some point, her sleep will, in fact, be periods of unconsciousness. She won't know about this or feel she is 'slipping away'; from her point of view, she'll be awake or not, that's all. She will stop eating and drinking at all, and at this point, you're down to days. A good rule of thumb is the pace of change in her energy, eating, sleeping, and symptoms. The faster things are moving, the nearer to the end, so changes over weeks = weeks left and so on. She will eventually lose consciousness and not regain it. This isn't likely to be sudden, and the hospice people will have a good sense of whether it's imminent. Then it's a matter of doing whatever brings you and her the most comfort. There will be changes in her breathing and appearance over these last days and hours. These are normal and won't distress her - again, ask hospice for support. They know what they are looking for and will demystify the process in a sensitive way. If you feel able, maybe try to talk with your wife about these changes as she probably perceives the difference in herself. If you haven't already, have some frank and loving conversations now about what constitutes a good death for her, and stay close and connected for as long as possible. As a caregiver, remember to ask for support from others if you can. As long as your wife is safe, clean, and comfortable, you can take a step back when you need to. Caring for someone at the end of life is the most difficult thing you'll ever do, but it is a privilege and has the potential to be deeply healing for you both. I wish you all the love and connectedness now, and when you reach that sad yet transformational time.

926,littleheaterlulu,My mom got sick when I was in my early 20s and passed a few years later. Something she did that still means a lot to me is that she put together a photo album (with real printed photos and all :) There are photos of me as a baby/kid and photos of us together but also photos of herself as a baby/kid as well as throughout her life. I would've had the photos either way but it's just so special that she put together the photo book for me so that they're all in one place (and it's meaningful also that she herself chose the photos to be included or not). It's been more than 20 years and I still get the photo album out and browse through it. I just went through it again last week!

931,lumpytorta,"I’m sorry you’re going through this.. as someone who was finally diagnosed at 28 I had a similar experience and was dealing with ongoing symptoms since I was 26. One doctor straight up told me to just take vitamin D when I told him I kept getting sick and my HR and BP shot up out of nowhere then he tried blaming it on my weight when I wasn’t even super overweight and I was very active. I was even blatantly misdiagnosed by the ER that found the primary tumor. It’s so frustrating because as females our pain is downplayed and we’re seen as over exaggerating but add in being young and we need to deal with the whole “you’re young you’re fine and can deal with it” doctor mindset too. It’s frustrating and I get so angry when I hear of people getting dismissed now. I’ve learned how to navigate through the healthcare system in a way no one should have to.lol I’m definitely eating a lot healthier as just the sight of anything greasy or sugary will make me want to gag. Like it makes me cringe almost if I take a bite out of anything too sweet or fatty. I love salty foods still though. During chemo I couldn’t eat anything warm/hot though because just the smells would trigger the nausea. I still get a bit of that now.Oof I wish I made that smart choice to have avocado sushi! I didn’t realize I was neutropenic already and thought I was ok to have a little bit of sushi at one point during chemo…boiii was I wronggg. I think that’s how I got e.coli and I was on the toilet for a week 😭I feel you on the bacon 🫡 just touching my tongue to it was enough to trigger painful heartburn during my chemo days and the smell it left in the house was usually too strong for me to be around. What was it like having a feeding tube if you don’t mind me asking?? I think I almost reached that point because I couldn’t eat or drink anything for almost two weeks due to constant gagging and nausea so I’m curious.I think it was McDonalds cheeseburgers that held me down for a bit when I couldn’t eat anything lolComplimentary pic of my chickies ✨Thanks I really appreciate it. I’m so tired right now but I can’t get myself to sleep. I’m just feeling all sorts of things both physically and emotionally right now that it’s freaking me out.

949,mfatty2,"The thoughts, especially before you get a full care plan in place are definitely normal. I had one doctor tell me he was certain my swollen lymph nodes weren't related to Lymphoma but we needed a biopsy. After it came back inconclusive, and we needed a larger sample he said ""we're not sure but it could be cancerous"" my thoughts started running wild. It turns out it was Hodgkins Lymphoma and was progressed from my neck into my lower abdomen. There were even a couple of spots on my kidneys (extremely rare for HL), found that out because I went into kidney failure before my biopsy surgery, and the hospital I was in got me on a schedule quicker. Now before I went into kidney failure, I had been talking with my now fiancee about whether or not she still wanted me to propose with the possibility of a cancer diagnosis. If she wanted out instead of possibly watching me die. I went into the hospital with kidney failure 3 days after I proposed. I thought for sure I was going to die in that hospital. Once I got my diagnosis, roughly 10 days after I was hospitalized, there were times where one moment I was certain I was going to die, and then the next I was certain I was going to fight like hell and be able to forget all of this happened. Nearly a year later and my cancer has been pushed back into only my neck. I will need a second treatment (just found out last Friday) but the first round wiped the cancer out of my abdomen completely. I no longer have those rollercoaster thoughts. Good luck to you, I'm never going to claim it gets easier but you do figure out what works for you and it helps keep the anxiety at bay. Everything you are feeling now is valid and normal.I was in treatment, completed it, had my 3 month post PET scan. It came back showing disease still. I scheduled at appointment before the end of July. My oncologist couldn't get me in until yesterday. It's normal unfortunately.

Good news and great updates are always welcome.I lost both parents to lung cancer. I was 16 when my dad passed, 54 with my mom. With mom it was a horrible rollercoaster ride, only time has lessened the acuteness of the pain.Is a remote second opinion possible in Canada?Please know that the Duropean Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO- https://www.esmo.org/) recommends lung cancer surgery only with curative intent. Another group you made guy want to connect with is LuCE-https://www.lungcancereurope.eu/. An organization for patients and caregivers.Chemo works because it destroys fast growing cells. That includes the tastebuds as well as hair, cilia, and bone marrow. One thing that may help with flavor of foods is using bamboo or plastic utensils to eat. -platin drugs make everything taste metallic, using an alternate helps offset that. Barleydogmom mentioned appetite stimulants. There are several that have been approved for patients like your dad, in addition to the Mirtazapine, your doctor might consider megace or marinol. Both are artificial canabinoids and FDA approved, insurance should cover them. If you live in a medical marijuana state, talk to a licensed dispensary about which CBD might be appropriate. Experiment with flavors. Things he used to love, he'll hate. Things he used to hate he may enjoy. The platinum drug he's receiving can only be taken 4-6 times. Their effect will wear off and his appetite should return.My stage 4 lung cancer was diagnosed almost 14 years ago. This is no longer the automatic death sentence it once was. There are two organizations I can recommend that have peer support people available for both the patient and others for the caregivers. The Cancer Support Community/Gilda's Clubs have support groups for patients and another for caregivers, family and friends. Peer support groups https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/find-location-near-you https://go2.org/resources-and-support/emotional-support/phone-buddy/ https://www.lungevity.org/for-patients-caregivers/support-services/peer-to-peer-mentoring/lifeline-support-partnersDana Farber has Nurse Navigators, if this was me, I would get in contact with that person and get their help getting those answers. That's part of their job description.Each of us here is today because someone, somewhere in time had a treatment or a surgery not knowing if the outcome would mean survival or not. You have to decide if you want to pay it forward or not. No judgement either way. As you said, do you want to risk side effects for no benefit or is it possible that other new cancers could result from your 40 year history and you might be preventing them? It's a very difficult decision and should not be made lightly.Those papers are quite accurate.

I had stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer but mine just had tumors in my lungs on both sides, not to distant organs, so definitely not as serious as your dad's. I was diagnosed in 2013, had chemo, surgery, radiation, chemo again, chemo once more, and finally SBRT radiation, and have scanned tumor free since 2015. I also did a TON of alternative and complimentary therapies. I was relatively young (53) and in general good health when diagnosed, so that helped as well. My surgery was at UW Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and my care there was excellent. Additional advice: keep a notebook with detailed notes of every office visit and several copies of all test results and scans. This will be REALLY helpful when your dad gets 2nd and 3rd opinions. Your dad will definitely get better care if you, or his spouse, or another friend or family member works as his advocate.

964,moseyeslee,"Yes very normal. Bladder cancer last year. Active immunotherapy. NED currently. My diagnosis was sudden. Down the first hill of the coaster. Before I knew i was likely to survive, I spent alot of time in bed and detached. Sometimes everything else moved quickly and I was inbslow motion. Always in deep thought. I gave things away to my friends, told the close ones goodbye just in case. Started setting up my wife for life without me around. Did alot of crying. I was mourning my life and what was possibly left of it. I was 48 years old. They found spots on my lungs mid game, and it was about 9 months before I knew those were benign and my current bladder cancer was isolated to my bladder. I now have a 70ish percent chance of getting high grade bladder cancer, and intravesicle immunotherapy lessens my chances of repeat tumors. It was a rough year. Many hills and loops on this coaster. 1 year later, I feel as if I'm on level track. Sometimes it speeds up and heads toward a hill, then flattens again. Couple small bumps. But ya know, I'm still here. I was positive I'd be dead by my next birthday and I just turned 49. I'm still scared, but I'm ready for death now when it finds me. I feel lucky though, many people don't get a chance to see what it's like to prep for death. We got a bit of practice in. Good luck and stay strong like you have been.

970,mthoody,"FOLFIRINOX is reserved for otherwise healthy patients because it is a brutal cocktail of three cytotoxic chemos (5FU, Oxaliplatin, and irinotecan). If the side effects are too much, they can downshift to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. My experience with the 5FU pump is as a minor inconvenience. I take Olanzapine every morning for nausea, it seems to work well for me. I’m not sure why you’re having trouble with your port, definitely discuss the tenderness with the nurse the next time they access your port. Some side effects are cumulative, others not so much. For example, the oxaliplatin cold sensitivity lessened for me, but the numbness was cumulative, to a point, then tapered off.Physician-assisted death (“Death with Dignity”) has been legal in Oregon since 1997. Today, legal in ten states plus DC.I’ve had 40 cycles of 5FU (fluorouracil), but always paired with either oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI). The last 32 of those cycles also included immunotherapy (panitumumab). I suspect just 5FU would have fewer side effects than what I experienced, which were reasonably tolerated. Not fun, but tolerable as far as chemo goes. One reason to give just 5FU is concern over the patient’s ability to tolerate oxaliplatin or irinotecan or an immunotherapy. How is your health other than the cancer? The 5FU is administered from a wearable pump over 46 hours. You may also receive a bolus dose on Day 1 via infusion. Experiment with clothing options for wearing the pump. I use a fleece vest with large inside pockets to hold the pump. I have a colostomy, so I couldn’t use the belly band they usually offer. They also offer a case with a strap, but I preferred my vest over the case with a strap (I still use the case, but I cut off the strap).Rectal cancer dx late 2019.

976,mykeawesome,"After I was diagnosed with Leukemia I had a distant relative crawl out of the wood work just to tell me ""there's a Dr in Itally using HYDEOGEN PEROXIDE to treat cancer like an infection."" The confidence of these people is astoundingEverytime I get admitted I fond myself coming back to Don't Bs Sad by Scotty Sire. https://youtu.be/O2gnE6qyLS4?si=-XVXbGirCiMDMoJUI was diagnosed with Leukemia (AML) at 35, almost exactly a month before my birthday. At the time I was in a successful career and was leveraging that experience to get a new better paying job. In fact the day I was diagnosed I was supposed to have my final interview with the hiring manager of the new job. My goal at that time was to get enough of a salary that I could let my wife quit her job and go back to school to pursue her own career goals. I also have a young daughter who was 3 at the time and I was contemplating what my career successes could afford her moving forward. Needless to say all of my plans went out the window after diagnosis. But I was quick to get into a bone marrow transplant and that was presented as ""the cure"" for my AML. I went through treatment and the long recovery process that went along with that. While recovering I spent a lot of time thinking about my previous career and realizing that I worked myself so hard that I probably broke down my own body health. I decided that I would focus on making my joy into my career and spent the next two years trying to build my own company. It was tough because the recovery was long but I was enjoying where I was putting my efforts in both my own work and having the opportunity to be home with my daughter. That whole time I was on disability but since I was in remission my time was running out to be on disability so I had to consider getting back into a job or pull the trigger on trying to make money from the company I was still working on. Well neither of those realities mattered because at 38 I was diagnosed with a relapse. I'm currently going through treatment and once again all plans have been thrown out the window. I still have to goal to launch my company and put my focus into that but the reality right now is that I'm struggling day to day just to be able to get up and make myself lunch. So my goals and ambitions have become more short sighted in that I'm just trying to be the best I can be day to day. My daughter is 6 now and I just try to pool my strength enough to be a good dad for her when she gets home from school. And my wife is still in the same job she had that I wad trying so hard to help her to grow out of. But now she has the only health insurance for the household and I'm dependent on her and her job to get my treatment. Fortunately her job has been very supportive and it's been a good place for her during all of this. But if your wondering how goals can change based on a young diagnosis, all I can say is it's hard to plan too far in the future because it feels like nothing is really stable after. Now I still have goals and ambitions but I no longer invest to heavily in them. My goal is just to be the best version of myself I can be day to day and to be there for my family in the best way I can. And my ambition is still to build my own company, but I accept that is dependent on my day to day health and ability to put in the effort. I no longer have the urge to constantly ""push through"" and instead try to give myself the patience and time to get there when I can.",345,0,0,"['start', 'after', 'i', 'diagnosed', 'leukemia', 'i', 'distant', 'relative', 'crawl', 'wood', 'work', 'tell', 'theres', 'dr', 'itally', 'using', 'hydeogen', 'peroxide', 'treat', 'cancer', 'like', 'infection', 'the', 'confidence', 'people', 'astoundingeverytime', 'i', 'get', 'admitted', 'i', 'fond', 'coming', 'back', 'dont', 'bs', 'sad', 'scotty', 'sire', 'httpsyoutubeo2gne6qyls4sixvxbgircimdmojui', 'diagnosed', 'leukemia', 'aml', '35', 'almost', 'exactly', 'month', 'birthday', 'at', 'time', 'i', 'successful', 'career', 'leveraging', 'experience', 'get', 'new', 'better', 'paying', 'job', 'in', 'fact', 'day', 'i', 'diagnosed', 'i', 'supposed', 'final', 'interview', 'hiring', 'manager', 'new', 'job', 'my', 'goal', 'time', 'get', 'enough', 'salary', 'i', 'could', 'let', 'wife', 'quit', 'job', 'go', 'back', 'school', 'pursue', 'career', 'goals', 'i', 'also', 'young', 'daughter', '3', 'time', 'i', 'contemplating', 'career', 'successes', 'could', 'afford', 'moving', 'forward', 'needless', 'say', 'plans', 'went', 'window', 'diagnosis', 'but', 'i', 'quick', 'get', 'bone', 'marrow', 'transplant', 'presented', 'cure', 'aml', 'i', 'went', 'treatment', 'long', 'recovery', 'process', 'went', 'along', 'while', 'recovering', 'i', 'spent', 'lot', 'time', 'thinking', 'previous', 'career', 'realizing', 'i', 'worked', 'hard', 'i', 'probably', 'broke', 'body', 'health', 'i', 'decided', 'i', 'would', 'focus', 'making', 'joy', 'career', 'spent', 'next', 'two', 'years', 'trying', 'build', 'company', 'it', 'tough', 'recovery', 'long', 'i', 'enjoying', 'i', 'putting', 'efforts', 'work', 'opportunity', 'home', 'daughter', 'that', 'whole', 'time', 'i', 'disability', 'since', 'i', 'remission', 'time', 'running', 'disability', 'i', 'consider', 'getting', 'back', 'job', 'pull', 'trigger', 'trying', 'make', 'money', 'company', 'i', 'still', 'working', 'well', 'neither', 'realities', 'mattered', '38', 'i', 'diagnosed', 'relapse', 'im', 'currently', 'going', 'treatment', 'plans', 'thrown', 'window', 'i', 'still', 'goal', 'launch', 'company', 'put', 'focus', 'reality', 'right', 'im', 'struggling', 'day', 'day', 'able', 'get', 'make', 'lunch', 'so', 'goals', 'ambitions', 'become', 'short', 'sighted', 'im', 'trying', 'best', 'i', 'day', 'day', 'my', 'daughter', '6', 'i', 'try', 'pool', 'strength', 'enough', 'good', 'dad', 'gets', 'home', 'school', 'and', 'wife', 'still', 'job', 'i', 'wad', 'trying', 'hard', 'help', 'grow', 'but', 'health', 'insurance', 'household', 'im', 'dependent', 'job', 'get', 'treatment', 'fortunately', 'job', 'supportive', 'good', 'place', 'but', 'wondering', 'goals', 'change', 'based', 'young', 'diagnosis', 'i', 'say', 'hard', 'plan', 'far', 'future', 'feels', 'like', 'nothing', 'really', 'stable', 'now', 'i', 'still', 'goals', 'ambitions', 'i', 'longer', 'invest', 'heavily', 'my', 'goal', 'best', 'version', 'i', 'day', 'day', 'family', 'best', 'way', 'i', 'and', 'ambition', 'still', 'build', 'company', 'i', 'accept', 'dependent', 'day', 'day', 'health', 'ability', 'put', 'effort', 'i', 'longer', 'urge', 'constantly', 'push', 'instead', 'try', 'give', 'patience', 'time', 'get', 'i', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['No symptoms identified'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,['Unable to specify'],Unable to specify

If you have an oncologist you can’t communicate with / you feel blocked by etc you can get fantastic information from them and loads of options to ask for that you might not have been offered. Or travel to one of the Maggies Centres who are also amazing. https://www.maggies.org/ Obviously you want to stop the cancer, but have you been referred to palliative care for pain control? They’re amazing too - it doesn’t mean they have given up on treating you - but they may offer far more creative options than the oncologist. Big hugs. I’m so sorry you’re going through this.The concept of a chosen family is fantastic. Chosen family are those who throughout your life have wanted the very best for you. It could be the one teacher who really saw the child you were, or an aunt or neighbour, or perhaps a pet who loved you unconditionally. They are your chosen family, and the positive energy they gave to you freely still lives with you today. Some of us are lucky enough to have chosen family members in their lives today. Cancer is incredible at pointing out who these people are. Love them, cherish them, make sure they know how much you appreciate them. Cut your losses with people who take energy from you, or their giving is totally conditional. Cancer is hard enough, but dealing with the hurt of people who are “supposed” to care makes dealing with cancer so much worse. Reflect on your chosen family who have given to you freely, and try to focus on them. They are worthy of your love. Even if they are not with you any more, they will help you heal.

Make sure you know when/how/who to call with any questions afterwards.It changed us- not better or worse, it's just different now. We lost some things and found some new ones. Cancer is stressful. I think it's important to not stress over anything but the most important stuff as much as you can. So if the dirty dishes are left in the sink, I don't sweat it.

You and your son, and whoever may accompany you, are able to share whatever comes in your way. In this world, we may share a room or a neighbourhood with people we couldn't care less about.

Like you said, you have been dealing with this ordeal for so long now, and yet I'm sure along with all the pain you managed to make some good memories. Many parents would say in spite of it all they feel lucky to have known their sons. And if this feels like shitty to no consolation, that's perfectly fine as well.

1003,pathofcollision,"I’m a nurse and I am so pro palliative care. Every single patient diagnosed with cancer needs palliative care. We need to do a better job of differentiating between palliative care and hospice/comfort care. They are not the same thing but patients often get them confused and healthcare professionals don’t do a good enough job at ensuring patients have the all the resources they can get to ensure they have the best possible quality of life.When my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer, I worked as a nurse in a toxic work environment. I was torn between knowing I needed to leave for my mental health and feeling like I needed to stay because I wouldn’t be eligible for FMLA if I started over someplace else, even though I knew my manager wouldn’t care about my situation. We had a nurse on our unit in her 30s that got diagnosed with advanced triple negative breast cancer and when she disclosed to our boss, our boss legitimately responded with, “how do you intend to continue working?”…because that was her priority, not fighting for her life. It wasn’t an easy decision, but I left. I took the risk. I was hired on at my current job. I let my boss know my circumstance immediately and let her know I would be eventually called to care for my mom, it was a matter of time. It ended up being only a matter of three months before chemo stopped working and we had to transition to hospice. My current boss, knowing I wasn’t eligible for leave, accommodated me in every way she could to ensure I was able to stay employed as a single mom who was caring for her dying mother. Trust in the timing of things. Go be with your family. On a side note, the genetic testing was something I did when my mom was diagnosed and I am glad that I did. No one can advocate for you better than you can. If you know what you’re predisposed to, then you know exactly what to push for when it comes to screening. Early detection makes a huge difference.

I was in ""maintenance"" for 15 months, so I had the illusion of safety. Every three weeks someone saw blood results. So SUPPOSEDLY if anything was really crazy someone would be alerted. Right? Um, not exactly I don't think. I paid FAR more attention to those numbers than anyone else. And every single time I asked questions I got ""I don't know"". WHY? Why don't you know? Jesus!

1011,pilarofsociety,"This is so wonderful. I’m really happy for you ❤️My mum (65) was diagnosed two months ago with stage 4 NSCLC (adenocarcinoma). It was a huge shock as she’s a non-smoker and has always been quite healthy. I’d strongly recommend a biopsy with genetic testing if that’s not already been requested. Some lung cancers occur due to a genetic mutation (like EGFR) and there’s targeted treatment available (Tagrisso for EGFR) that’s highly effective for most patients with such mutation. Stage 4 cancer is a lot to deal with, but I can say our family is in a much better place now than at the start, when there was so much uncertainty, fear, and not knowing how to navigate through it all. You will work it out together. Sending you strength.Really sorry to hear about your mum. I have a similar story. My mum went to see the doctor about back pain a couple of months ago and was diagnosed with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer that’s metastasised to the spine. The biopsy results will be very important because if she has certain gene mutations she can have targeted treatment (like Tagrisso for EGFR mutation) that can be effective for a while with few side effects. There are people who have taken Tagrisso for years on Reddit and other forums. So make sure they do genetic testing as part of the biopsy. I’d advise against reading the survival stats online. The data is mostly very old, before the availability of targeted treatment. The data also doesn’t separate by age, so you have 80/90 year olds who were near the end alongside much younger people. Sending you strength ❤️Wonderful news, thank you for sharing the positivity, and wishing you continued progress.Thank you, I really appreciate this. What was the trajectory like in the days after starting radio, e.g. did you feel worse before feeling better? She has bone destruction at c5 and L5. I just want her to feel a bit better so she can see there is hope.Thank you for your story, that gives me a lot of hope.She’s in NI and it’s public holidays until Tuesday frustratingly. She was told maybe she’ll see the oncologist a week later, but it’s very vague. I’m very frustrated by the whole process (NHS) but appreciate it can be a whole lot worse.Thank you, I’m glad you’re feeling better. They’re doing the gene mutation testing and I’m hopeful for EGFR as she’s an east Asian non-smoker. I just need to get that oncologist appt asap.Thanks for your reply. I’m in EGFR resisters and it’s very informative. This is for when we have the exact mutation information - but is there a resource on prognosis by mutation? For example, the prognosis for those with mutations that can be targeted must be better than for those without.Thank you for this. Did they say prognosis for Tagrisso is 5 years?UPDATE: My mum saw her oncologist today who said she has EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation, plus a rare ILE706THR mutation. She’s starting Tagrisso next week assuming her blood tests are normal. The doctor said Tagrisso works on average for 2 years but varies. In the circumstances, I think this is positive. I hope everyone else is doing ok.Thank you, same to you ❤️Thanks so much for this. What did the doctor say to you about the prognosis, if you don’t mind me asking? My mum is such a trooper too. So unnecessarily. She won’t even take paracetamol during the day, so she does take something for night time.Thank you for this. It’s comforting.

1012,pinkpeony90,"I’m so sorry, I was 31 when I had my hysterectomy. I had endometrial cancer. I didn’t have kids, and I’m unable to carry obviously. It robbed me of my happiness. I don’t feel women enough most days. I will pray for you.I think about this. I have no reason to live frankly. I’m 34, but I have lost everything. I don’t have a penny to my name. I don’t have family to support me either. I’m on so many pain meds that I don’t feel much of anything anymore. I would like to die, but I’m a Christian therefore it feels as if I am basically committing suicide. It’s something I struggle with. I really want to go this route, but it’s just that, my belief is God will take us when it’s our time, but I’m losing all faith and quite frankly I’m am mad at God. Like why? Why this? I hope you are at peace with whatever route you choose. I am tired. I am ready to go. But my boyfriend will be really sad. That’s the only person I’m holding on to.I have lung nodules since 2022, and they have grown but I’m always told it’s no big deal. This scares me because I’ve had cancer two times already, and now my oxygen level is low and nothing like before and I wish they would do more tests on these. I also have liver lessions, 2 were found in ER as accidental finding. I went to my cancer center because of my colon cancer, and they found that the lesions have grown and there’s actually four instead of 2. So they do a MRI which was inconclusive, and they’re too hypo dense whatever that means and not normal. So they have to monitor them. My question is why not just do a biopsy and get an answer for me then. I don’t like waiting and not knowing. I’m always in pain. Vomiting and so forth. We will see October on my repeat tests. I’m so sorry what you’re going through and I’ll pray that it all turns out fine and Jesus takes control.

1018,puffedovenpancake,I’m so sorry. When I was diagnosed it took a week to get biomarkers back. I had a liquid biopsy. Because I was also a never smoker and a middle aged female they said I probably had a biomarker. Once they know the biomarker they can begin the correct treatment. I think it was about 3 weeks between an mri showing a tumor and when treatment started. I too was having issues (breathing and pain) that were getting worse. I had a pleural effusion that showed up on the mri and had to have it drained which helped a lot. Once treatment started I slowly started feeling a lot better over the next few weeks. It’s so frustrating and scary to wait. I look back and a lot of that time is a blur. I’m sorry you are here. Best wishes to your mom and you and your family.Have you been to dana farber?

1036,rollerG12,"Thank you and best of luck!I don’t have any biomarkers. My cancer is KRAS mutated.Sorry you’re experiencing this…I just want to say, that side effects are not always cumulative and everybody is different. My first round of chemo was also the hardest, yet I just finished cycle 5 of 6 and this past cycle was the easiest so far. It was almost like my body had a tough time for the first round because the chemo was so foreign to my body, but it adjusted overtime. It might be tough all of the way through. Take it a day at a time. Dont worry about the 8+ more rounds, just get through today. Do that over and over again, and eventually you will be done. Anything worth doing is difficult.Well said. I struggled with the notion of “fighting” at first. I thought about the people who are so sick at the time of their diagnosis that they don’t even get the chance to “fight” and we would never say that they didn’t “fight” or “gave up” or whatever, so I keep thinking to myself how on earth can we call it a fight when it seems like luck/random for those who even get an opportunity to see treatment and have a chance to survive…I almost felt like calling it “fighting” was a slap in the face to those who don’t have a chance to “fight”… Then I came to my own conclusion that fighting is just continuing on with cancer. Whether it’s showing up to work every day, or laying in a hospital bed. Whether you feel great or you’re encumbered by intense pain. The second that you realize that you have cancer, your fight begins whether you know it or not, and no matter what you decide your plan of action/treatment (or lack there of) will be. Much love. Stay strong out there 💪.28 with stage 4 lung cancerSeriously. I got my last scan results back within 3 hours.I feel pretty good, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I was told that I’m early in treatment so we aren’t even necessarily expecting shrinkage because the immunotherapy may not have had enough time to begin working yet. So I am very happy to see a response already, I am hoping that this is a good sign for long term results. Second, through my lung cancer journey I have been reading about how new genetic mutations and targeted therapy are “changing the game” for lung cancer treatment and how it’s saving lives. However, I have found way less hopeful insight around treatment for patients that do not have these targetable mutations, and I do not have any of these mutations so I was worried that treatment would be less effective for me. I almost felt left out and like I had less hope. I am hoping that I will have some continued success with treatment and can provide hope for patients who don’t have targeted therapy and have to stick with the standard chemo/immunotherapy. Overall, we are not out of the woods yet, but for how early I am in treatment I think this is a very good response and we wouldn’t be expecting much more this early on based on what I discussed with my care team.",307,0,0,"['start', 'thank', 'best', 'lucki', '’', 'biomarkers', 'my', 'cancer', 'kras', 'mutatedsorry', '’', 'experiencing', 'this…i', 'want', 'say', 'side', 'effects', 'always', 'cumulative', 'everybody', 'different', 'my', 'first', 'round', 'chemo', 'also', 'hardest', 'yet', 'i', 'finished', 'cycle', '5', '6', 'past', 'cycle', 'easiest', 'far', 'it', 'almost', 'like', 'body', 'tough', 'time', 'first', 'round', 'chemo', 'foreign', 'body', 'adjusted', 'overtime', 'it', 'might', 'tough', 'way', 'take', 'day', 'time', 'dont', 'worry', '8', 'rounds', 'get', 'today', 'do', 'eventually', 'done', 'anything', 'worth', 'difficultwell', 'said', 'i', 'struggled', 'notion', '“', 'fighting', '”', 'first', 'i', 'thought', 'people', 'sick', 'time', 'diagnosis', '’', 'even', 'get', 'chance', '“', 'fight', '”', 'would', 'never', 'say', '’', '“', 'fight', '”', '“', 'gave', '”', 'whatever', 'i', 'keep', 'thinking', 'earth', 'call', 'fight', 'seems', 'like', 'luckrandom', 'even', 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'treatment', 'chance', 'survive…i', 'almost', 'felt', 'like', 'calling', '“', 'fighting', '”', 'slap', 'face', '’', 'chance', '“', 'fight', '”', '…', 'then', 'i', 'came', 'conclusion', 'fighting', 'continuing', 'cancer', 'whether', '’', 'showing', 'work', 'every', 'day', 'laying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'whether', 'feel', 'great', '’', 'encumbered', 'intense', 'pain', 'the', 'second', 'realize', 'cancer', 'fight', 'begins', 'whether', 'know', 'matter', 'decide', 'plan', 'actiontreatment', 'lack', 'much', 'love', 'stay', 'strong', '💪28', 'stage', '4', 'lung', 'cancerseriously', 'i', 'got', 'last', 'scan', 'results', 'back', 'within', '3', 'hoursi', 'feel', 'pretty', 'good', 'couple', 'reasons', 'firstly', 'i', 'told', 'i', '’', 'early', 'treatment', '’', 'even', 'necessarily', 'expecting', 'shrinkage', 'immunotherapy', 'may', 'enough', 'time', 'begin', 'working', 'yet', 'so', 'i', 'happy', 'see', 'response', 'already', 'i', 'hoping', 'good', 'sign', 'long', 'term', 'results', 'second', 'lung', 'cancer', 'journey', 'i', 'reading', 'new', 'genetic', 'mutations', 'targeted', 'therapy', '“', 'changing', 'game', '”', 'lung', 'cancer', 'treatment', '’', 'saving', 'lives', 'however', 'i', 'found', 'way', 'less', 'hopeful', 'insight', 'around', 'treatment', 'patients', 'targetable', 'mutations', 'i', 'mutations', 'i', 'worried', 'treatment', 'would', 'less', 'effective', 'i', 'almost', 'felt', 'left', 'like', 'i', 'less', 'hope', 'i', 'hoping', 'i', 'continued', 'success', 'treatment', 'provide', 'hope', 'patients', '’', 'targeted', 'therapy', 'stick', 'standard', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'overall', 'woods', 'yet', 'early', 'i', 'treatment', 'i', 'think', 'good', 'response', '’', 'expecting', 'much', 'early', 'based', 'i', 'discussed', 'care', 'team', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Targeted Therapy', 'Chemotherapy']",carcinoma

Fast forward to last year the cancer came back and is now stage 4, she once again won’t go the conventional way and found this treatment called DON. It’s at a very experimental stage and is taking this up on her own. She has to eat in a very specific way and go into hbot chambers when taking the DON doses so it kills the cancer properly.

I know your favorite foods taste terrible, but you have to reduce your weight loss for you're going to lose 10's of pounds, otherwise you will have no energy at all, and these drugs are going to give you major fatigue.

1055,sizzlingtofu,Probably not the best comparison because my friend hadn’t been to the doctor in YEARS and was relatively healthy. She had a stroke out of the blue which they confirmed was caused from cancer clotting her blood and she died three weeks later. She had not really been eating a few months though and kind of keeping to herself about it. I would say when she hits a point where she does not want to eat at all that’s a sign the end is near. It’s tough if you’re taking meds that might affect appetite. She also had no pain. I think a cough but not severe she had smoked for 58 years and quit 3 months before this happened.Personally having sat with her everyday for her last 3 weeks I would recommend MAID.

1057,sleddingdeer,"This is your decision and you’ve had enough experience to understand what your choice entails. You need to tell your doctor first and perhaps your oncologist can speak to your parents for you or with you to help them understand. It sounds like your parents aren’t going to give you their permission, but you have reached the age when you don’t need it. This is never going to be easy for them to accept so go at your own pace. They will come to terms with it. They have no choice. I’m sorry. Chemo is awful. Some regimes are absolutely unbearable. I’m really sorry you got this raw deal. I think you are very brave for listening to your inner voice. I wish you peace and a miracle.I find this comment cruel. This is OP’s life and they have every right to make decisions that are best for them. In OP’s case being strong means choosing quality of life over quantity because that’s what’s in their heart.Be direct. “Aunt, I know you mean well, but you must stop suggesting treatment options to me. I am comfortable with my medical team and you are inadvertently hurting me and stressing me out. I know that you love me and that is unintentional, but I need you to hear me when I tell you to stop.” She will feel bad and may get defensive, but do not engage any further. Just say, I have told you how I feel and that’s not going to change. If she persists, leave, end the conversation. Every single time.I’m sorry. Unfortunately, many people are disappointing in crises which is incredibly painful. First, ask for money again. See if you can get some. I say that because it’s an absolute necessity and if you can get some help, it’s worth enduring the awkwardness. I had a major medical event and agonizing recovery and also got basically no help from most of my family. It was traumatic and made me feel so unloved. It’s important to recognize and honor the depths of your wound rather than rush to forgive. I also question the need to forgive people who aren’t apologetic. If they don’t see that their behavior was wrong, the problem is ongoing. For me, I had to process my pain as trauma and it was really hard and took a long time. I had to understand how their actions touched on childhood pain so I could detangle and understand my feelings. Then I decided that it permanently changed how I felt about them. I am relieved of my obligations for the rest of my life. This isn’t to say I might willingly give and be of service, but I am completely free of a duty to anyone on this planet excluding my children. There is not a guilt string to pull in my heart. I relish this freedom. After I had processed my trauma and healed physically, I had some heart to hearts with some people (maybe you’d want to do that with your parents) where I explained how their lack of care cut deep. It felt good to say what I wanted to say and I didn’t feel the need to sugarcoat it, though I wasn’t ranting either. I came to an important understanding with one family member that carved a path to reconciliation. That wouldn’t have been possible if my pain was fresh and unprocessed. I still do not feel any sense of obligation. People define forgiveness differently, but to me it often sounds like a conditioned response to sweep things under the rug or else you’ll be an angry bitter person. I think that’s hogwash! I did deep work and have moved forward, rather than forgiving them. My internal work helped me accept and then let go of what happened which I think is important for my heart. My decision to move forward reflects my choice not to feel isolated and without family, which is an act of love for myself. I don’t want to live in exile. But I have changed and our relationships have changed. That fact helps me because it acknowledges the truth of what happened. I feel a sense of power and autonomy in my family that I never had before. I genuinely feel free in those relationships and there is value in that. I can enjoy the benefits and reject the obligations that come with family.",420,0,0,"['start', 'this', 'decision', '’', 'enough', 'experience', 'understand', 'choice', 'entails', 'you', 'need', 'tell', 'doctor', 'first', 'perhaps', 'oncologist', 'speak', 'parents', 'help', 'understand', 'it', 'sounds', 'like', 'parents', '’', 'going', 'give', 'permission', 'reached', 'age', '’', 'need', 'this', 'never', 'going', 'easy', 'accept', 'go', 'pace', 'they', 'come', 'terms', 'they', 'choice', 'i', '’', 'sorry', 'chemo', 'awful', 'some', 'regimes', 'absolutely', 'unbearable', 'i', '’', 'really', 'sorry', 'got', 'raw', 'deal', 'i', 'think', 'brave', 'listening', 'inner', 'voice', 'i', 'wish', 'peace', 'miraclei', 'find', 'comment', 'cruel', 'this', 'op', '’', 'life', 'every', 'right', 'make', 'decisions', 'best', 'in', 'op', '’', 'case', 'strong', 'means', 'choosing', 'quality', 'life', 'quantity', '’', '’', 'heartbe', 'direct', '“', 'aunt', 'i', 'know', 'mean', 'well', 'must', 'stop', 'suggesting', 'treatment', 'options', 'i', 'comfortable', 'medical', 'team', 'inadvertently', 'hurting', 'stressing', 'i', 'know', 'love', 'unintentional', 'i', 'need', 'hear', 'i', 'tell', 'stop', '”', 'she', 'feel', 'bad', 'may', 'get', 'defensive', 'engage', 'just', 'say', 'i', 'told', 'i', 'feel', '’', 'going', 'change', 'if', 'persists', 'leave', 'end', 'conversation', 'every', 'single', 'timei', '’', 'sorry', 'unfortunately', 'many', 'people', 'disappointing', 'crises', 'incredibly', 'painful', 'first', 'ask', 'money', 'see', 'get', 'i', 'say', '’', 'absolute', 'necessity', 'get', 'help', '’', 'worth', 'enduring', 'awkwardness', 'i', 'major', 'medical', 'event', 'agonizing', 'recovery', 'also', 'got', 'basically', 'help', 'family', 'it', 'traumatic', 'made', 'feel', 'unloved', 'it', '’', 'important', 'recognize', 'honor', 'depths', 'wound', 'rather', 'rush', 'forgive', 'i', 'also', 'question', 'need', 'forgive', 'people', '’', 'apologetic', 'if', '’', 'see', 'behavior', 'wrong', 'problem', 'ongoing', 'for', 'i', 'process', 'pain', 'trauma', 'really', 'hard', 'took', 'long', 'time', 'i', 'understand', 'actions', 'touched', 'childhood', 'pain', 'i', 'could', 'detangle', 'understand', 'feelings', 'then', 'i', 'decided', 'permanently', 'changed', 'i', 'felt', 'i', 'relieved', 'obligations', 'rest', 'life', 'this', '’', 'say', 'i', 'might', 'willingly', 'give', 'service', 'i', 'completely', 'free', 'duty', 'anyone', 'planet', 'excluding', 'children', 'there', 'guilt', 'string', 'pull', 'heart', 'i', 'relish', 'freedom', 'after', 'i', 'processed', 'trauma', 'healed', 'physically', 'i', 'heart', 'hearts', 'people', 'maybe', '’', 'want', 'parents', 'i', 'explained', 'lack', 'care', 'cut', 'deep', 'it', 'felt', 'good', 'say', 'i', 'wanted', 'say', 'i', '’', 'feel', 'need', 'sugarcoat', 'though', 'i', '’', 'ranting', 'either', 'i', 'came', 'important', 'understanding', 'one', 'family', 'member', 'carved', 'path', 'reconciliation', 'that', '’', 'possible', 'pain', 'fresh', 'unprocessed', 'i', 'still', 'feel', 'sense', 'obligation', 'people', 'define', 'forgiveness', 'differently', 'often', 'sounds', 'like', 'conditioned', 'response', 'sweep', 'things', 'rug', 'else', '’', 'angry', 'bitter', 'person', 'i', 'think', '’', 'hogwash', 'i', 'deep', 'work', 'moved', 'forward', 'rather', 'forgiving', 'my', 'internal', 'work', 'helped', 'accept', 'let', 'go', 'happened', 'i', 'think', 'important', 'heart', 'my', 'decision', 'move', 'forward', 'reflects', 'choice', 'feel', 'isolated', 'without', 'family', 'act', 'love', 'i', '’', 'want', 'live', 'exile', 'but', 'i', 'changed', 'relationships', 'changed', 'that', 'fact', 'helps', 'acknowledges', 'truth', 'happened', 'i', 'feel', 'sense', 'power', 'autonomy', 'family', 'i', 'never', 'i', 'genuinely', 'feel', 'free', 'relationships', 'value', 'i', 'enjoy', 'benefits', 'reject', 'obligations', 'come', 'family', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,['Chemotherapy'],Unable to specify

1062,smartypants333,"February of 2021 my appendix burst. While they were scanning for that they said ""Huh, we see a little something here in your lung. It's probably nothing, but you should probably get it checked out when you get out of the hospital."" Got it checked out, it was stage 1 lung cancer. While they were doing the scans for that so they could remove the lower right lobe of my lung (April) they found a brain tumor. ""It's not cancer, but it still needs to come out."" So after I recovered from my lung surgery, I had brain surgery in June. They said that I was cancer free at that point, but it came back stage 4 (in my bones) 18 months later (Sept 2022).I was let go because I personally had cancer, and requested to continue to work from home for 3 additional months (in 2021 when Covid was still in full effect!) Companies aren't messing around with this RTO BS. And although I probably could have sued, I didn't want to waste my time. If I didn't sign away my right to sue they wouldn't give me my 2 months severance.I got ""the button"" for the 3 days I was in the hospital after my lobectomy. The nurse was also nice enough to set it up so the end would light up when I could have another dose. I was in a lot of pain, and it didn't get a whole lot better once I got home, but unlike some have said, my doctors did gave me opioid pain meds. My oncology team also refilled my prescription anytime I ask. I've been VERY careful not to ""dose up.""I was diagnosed stage 1 in 2021 (age 43), had surgery (to remove the lower right lobe of my lung) and was told I was cancer free. It recurred 18 months later (2022), stage 4, now in my bones and the pleural lining. I am going to say, that for me, I'm experiencing the absolute blessing that is modern medicine. I hesitate to say blessing because I'm not religious. My cancer has a genetic mutation that can be blocked with a targeted treatment. A single pill I take every day that has minimal side effects.

It was quite literally the most important part of my recovery. I definitely had these sentiments I thought why on earth did I fight so hard just to go back to this grind, work pay bills, where are the epic bucket list moments. Instead of celebrating my body’s ability to heal I felt betrayed. I felt like a ghost in the in between. Therapy helped me gain perspective and resolve my anger around my missed diagnosis. Maybe your area offers free cancer support networks. I am sorry you feel this way. ❤️Pain in my rib back, tried physio, acupuncture, yoga nothing helped eventually got so bad I would yelp whenever I moved. Doc ordered CT was read negative for everything no osseous lesion detected. I thought impossible and working in physical rehab I got my images not just report. Found a black hole pathological fracture of 8 th rib in 156 of 1300 images. Knew instantly I was looking at a lytic lesion. With much difficulty and mention of involving CPSO I got bone scan. Confirmed malignant. Biopsy later. Langerhans cell sarcoma. Thoracotomy to remove 8th rib and chunk of chest wall. Currently NED.I completely appreciate your approach! I can’t imagine your experience, that’s the thing with cancer it is so individual. In our situation with stage iv pancreatic unfortunately we don’t have 13 years to gain perspective or a thicker skin. I thought I could maybe just provide some insight and impact some of the communication for our immediate situation. I know there are folks who embrace the fight language and made point to acknowledge that. I hope your daily balance continues to be more about life and less about cancer. Thanks for the insight ☮️I appreciate the you got this between you and your wife. It paints a nice image of support and encouragement in the moment. Positive not hopeful is a great observation. I think that is exactly what we are. When you know your are terminal and treatment is to extend life and maybe push things back gain some quality in that time the focus is different. We definitely focus on the positives keep our perspective a bit more narrow and in the now. I am sorry for the loss of your friend and I hope for the best outcome for you and your wife.That’s all you can do.

1120,wisteria_town,"Ports can dislodge afaik. But not easily. I was told by a nurse that one of the kids on my pedi ward was playing once and doing some tumbles or something. Her port was accessed & apparently it dislodged because of her movements. I wouldn't really risk it tbh. It probably wouldn't be comfortable either. I know I get uncomfortable on things like bumpy car rides with my port in place, even when it's not being accessed. Couldn't tell you about how painful port placement is since I was knocked out for mine. Moved around like a robot for 3 days. But afterwards the pain subsided and I had no more issues with it. Port access doesn't hurt either, I never needed any numbing cream or stuff. It's honestly less painful than getting a regular blood draw. Just a pinch at best, sometimes I'd wait for the nurse to access my port (put the needle in) like ""Did it go in?"" because I wouldn't even feel it.Being direct and telling her you do not need any treatment suggestions is one way, but I found that it doesn't help. Honestly. People think they know best and you cannot shake that. You can argue with them until you're blue in the face & they'll still come out of it thinking ""Well I know best and I want what's best for (OP) why don't they accept my help!!"". I've had this encounter a hundred times over, literally just today too. I've stopped arguing & just retreat nowadays. A personal experience would be when a lady whose daughter has soft tissue cancer iirc was talking my ear off about going vegan, cutting sugar out, ""natural remedies"" all of that bullshit. She literally told me ""Well get on eating!!"" with a snarky tone (when she heard my CBC was low) & when I explained I've a bunch of restrictions that don't allow me to eat a variety of food (neutropenic diet & precautions that have been working wonders for me, not a single infection so far) she said I ""trust my doctors too much"". Thanks boo, I'll keep trusting them, I don't feel like dying yet. I know she's your aunt & you don't want to hurt her feelings but don't let her hurt yours. I'm sure she wants what's best for you but boundaries have to be established. This well I know the secret remedy! stuff is dangerous behavior IMO because while you might not fall for it, others will. See the lady above. Best of luck & health OP 🤍🤍🤍OP I'm 17 & also have blood cancer (acute myeloblastic leukemia). So sorry you had to join this shitty club.

Does he not know that at the basic level cancer is any cell in your body that fails apoptosis and continues to replicate and that blood is made of cells?

1130,zeerorequiem,"Never had APL, but I did have ALL. I totally relate on the cognitive effects tho. I was still in school so of course the work was easier than university, but I just feel like now i’m sooo out of my depth all the time. I can never remember anything, always struggle to think of the correct words and just constantly feel “scattered” lol. I sometimes wonder if I have ADD, and definitely feel it’s only hit me after treatment :/ I’m 7 years out of a BMT and honestly this is the worst i’ve ever felt mentally. No idea what’s brought it on, but every time I go for checkups I end up in the bathroom crying and my whole day is ruined lol. I keep struggling with “enjoying life” because every moment I have to spend doing something I don’t enjoy (like work), I feel .. guilty I guess ?? It’s hard to pin-point the emotion, but I just always feel like what’s the point in having gone through all of that to spend half my life being miserable in a job lol. I’ve lurked on posts of people with similar experiences and the consensus looks like therapy is the answer but for the life of me I can’t bring myself to talk about how I feel irl :/ I’m also prone to writing novels 😆 but I hope you’re doing ok !! and wishing you good health :)",153,0,0,"['start', 'never', 'apl', 'i', 'all', 'i', 'totally', 'relate', 'cognitive', 'effects', 'tho', 'i', 'still', 'school', 'course', 'work', 'easier', 'university', 'i', 'feel', 'like', '’', 'sooo', 'depth', 'time', 'i', 'never', 'remember', 'anything', 'always', 'struggle', 'think', 'correct', 'words', 'constantly', 'feel', '“', 'scattered', '”', 'lol', 'i', 'sometimes', 'wonder', 'i', 'add', 'definitely', 'feel', '’', 'hit', 'treatment', 'i', '’', '7', 'years', 'bmt', 'honestly', 'worst', '’', 'ever', 'felt', 'mentally', 'no', 'idea', '’', 'brought', 'every', 'time', 'i', 'go', 'checkups', 'i', 'end', 'bathroom', 'crying', 'whole', 'day', 'ruined', 'lol', 'i', 'keep', 'struggling', '“', 'enjoying', 'life', '”', 'every', 'moment', 'i', 'spend', 'something', 'i', '’', 'enjoy', 'like', 'work', 'i', 'feel', 'guilty', 'i', 'guess', 'it', '’', 'hard', 'pinpoint', 'emotion', 'i', 'always', 'feel', 'like', '’', 'point', 'gone', 'spend', 'half', 'life', 'miserable', 'job', 'lol', 'i', '’', 'lurked', 'posts', 'people', 'similar', 'experiences', 'consensus', 'looks', 'like', 'therapy', 'answer', 'life', 'i', '’', 'bring', 'talk', 'i', 'feel', 'irl', 'i', '’', 'also', 'prone', 'writing', 'novels', '😆', 'i', 'hope', '’', 'ok', 'wishing', 'good', 'health', 'end']",Unable to identify / not sure if it is,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['No symptoms identified'],1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,['Unable to specify'],Unable to specify
