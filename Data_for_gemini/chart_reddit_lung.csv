35,Affectionate_Bid1548,"Lost my aunt two weeks ago to lung cancer that metastasised to her breast, rib and spine. She was paralysed from waist down. She was diagnosed 5 days after initial paralysis after A&E sent her home to be literally carries/dragged by her son and daughter. I understand the heartache and anger all too well. She had asked her Dr, A&E and Out of hours for an X-ray in January because she was in excruciating pain and all three of them turned her away. Three months later she was paralysed from the waist down and non even three months after that she passed. Treatment wise there was nothing they could do, radiotherapy didn’t work and as she was immobile chemo wasn’t an option. She was in palliative care at home but had to spend almost two weeks in hospital after catching covid, e-coli in her urine etc. The Saturday before she passed she was taken into hospital by ambulance, the Dr wanted to keep her in but she wanted to go home so we took her home. She passed a week later at home surrounded by her loved ones. If your mum wants home take her home! If the hospital can’t help then there’s no need for her to be there. This disease is absolutely horrific and declines happen suddenly and quickly. Cherish every moment. We were told to expect between 4-6 months and she only lived four weeks. A few hours before she passed we were told another few days and she passed within hours. From what I’m reading, your mums condition is declining pretty quickly and it may be time to start closing the chapter. I know it’s so hard and I’m so so sorry you’re going through this. If you want someone to speak to a bit further, don’t hesitate to reach out.

73,Bama-1970,"I had RATS (Robot Assisted Thoracic Surgery) last December for a 1.2 cm Type 1A pulmonary nodule, which consisted of acinar and lepidic type adenocarcinoma. I had three small incisions below my rib cage on my left side, one for the camera and two for the instruments. They went through my rib cage to perform the surgery, breaking a rib. I spent 2 days in the hospital. I was discharged with OxyContin, but I didn’t have to take it. I took Tylenol for pain. The surgery itself wasn’t bad. My primary complications were atrial flutter and urinary retention from the OxyContin they gave me in the hospital. All the complications were resolved within five weeks after surgery. The surgery isn’t anything to be afraid of. It’s the best chance you have for a cure. The surgery makes you short of breath, so you have to use an Inspirometer for breathing for a while and walk to build up your lung capacity after surgery. They got all my cancer and found no evidence of cancer in my lymph nodes. I have to have CT scans every six months for five years to check for evidence of recurrence. I currently have no evidence of disease with a good chance the cancer won’t recur.Look in to RATS lung cancer surgery. I spent two days in the hospital. No oxygen after surgery.

But the primary lung had nothing to do with my Stage II esophagus cancer. Having two distinct cancers at the same time is quite rare. They could NOT operate on the esophagus as having Stage IV in full blown metastasis mode was not an option. They elected for chemo/radiation on esophagus, while taking targeted therapy for lung.

424,MindlessParsley1446,"Thank you for sharing this. I'm so happy to hear the encouraging update on your mom ❤️❤️❤️May I ask why you don't have an oncologist? I'm really sorry to hear of your struggles. I've had many myself. I found that utilizing my anger energy towards doing some of the crappy stuff like dealing with thousands of dollars in insurance claims helped me through it - I felt like it was something within my control at least..I had no symptoms whatsoever. Stage IV lung cancer (ROS1+ Non-Small Cell)Hi, there and sorry to hear about your husband. I had an upper lobectomy last August. The recovery for me was definitely tolerable with pain medication. I was able to walk just fine, and did so as soon as the weather cooperated (midwesterner here, and weather can be all over the place!). I walked regularly to help improve lung capacity and strength. Sleeping was a challenge, though. I ended up purchasing a wedge pillow set (convertible for various angles and an under-the-knee pillow for support and comfort). I had to sleep sitting straight up for about a month (maybe more, can't remember now!). I also got a neck pillow to support my neck during sleep. I experienced what I call ""zingers"" where the incisions were, so was prescribed Gabapentin to help with that. I had the Robotic-assisted surgery, so about 5 small incisions. Since the opioids blocked me up, I made sure to take stool softener and also powdered Miralax to help keep things moving. Best of luck ❤️YES! 2nd leading cause is Radon!Fantastic news!! Congratulations 😊❤️When I went through chemo once/week via IV infusions of Carbo/Taxol, I made sure to drink plenty of water in order to help prep my veins for the IV as well as to help flush out my system. I brought and iPod with earbuds so I could listen to music. I went alone each time, and didn't want to hear any other noise from my surroundings there (peace of mind, I suppose). They did provide me blankets and snacks, which was so nice. I taped the ""instruction sheet"" to my fridge at home so my family would know what to watch for, as far as side effects/fever, etc, and the phone number to call if we needed help or had ANY questions. 😊 I'm praying for an uneventful experience for you and your mom.

508,Party_Author_9337,"So most young non smoker with lung cancer have a targetable dna mutation. I did not. But most do. And if they do, there is a good chance that they can be treated with specific medications. I think it took about a month for my bio markers to come back. It was a long wait.I am sorry about your teenage lung cancer. That should never happen. It’s just not fair. I was 38 when I was diagnosed, which is still young for lung cancer but not pediatric. Ask your oncologist to talk to a social worker. They can get you in touch with support groups. I found a lot of comfort in this group. There are a few other women I have met via TikTok who are also in their 30s with lung cancerI ate pretzels and watermelon the week after chemo. It causes a really bad taste in my mouth. So I didn’t have much of an appetiteI was 39 when I did my chemo for lung cancer. It wiped me out days 3-6 I would take multiple naps a day. I would purchase a urinal from Amazon incase the fatigue from chemo makes it hard for your dad to get to the bathroom. Also, have his doctors prescribed a Walker? Or maybe useful if you have to take him back to the office the first week post chemo. Has he tried sleeping with a wedge pillow? Google pills for acid reflex. That might help keep him upright but let him stretch out in bed. I am glad he is drinking water now. Chemo can change your taste buds for a week or two. So water may taste bad. Buy some flavored water packets. Don’t stock up on anything pre chemo. I also lived alone and I bought what I thought I would want to eat if I had the stomach but. But my taste was so off, I didn’t want any of it. Made me hate the taste of the yellow gatoraid. Which was my favorite. I was able to drink the blue flavor, which I normally don’t like. If he is already really bad at eating, you might want to look into continuous glucose monitor. See if he would wear it. That way you can see if his sugar is going too low from not eatingAsk about pain medication for home use after the surgery. My surgeon refused to treat pain with opioids. After two to three weeks of unbearable pain, my friend suggested I reach out to my oncologist. She had no issue treating my pain. Use the incentive spirometer. And walk. Sleeping can be uncomfortable. Make sure you have a few comfy pillows in different sizes to help find a position of comfortI was 38 when I was diagnosed, non smoker. I wish I could blame it on stress. But we don’t know why it’s more commonI had a lobectomy for my lung cancer. I was never offered radiation. I am glad the tumor was removed. I also had like 20 lymph nodes removed and biopsied.The chemo days will have you at the infusion center almost all day. Be prepared to hurry up and wait. Usually the access the port and draw labs. Wait for the lab results. Then wait for in the drugs to be prepared. My oncologist would hydrate me with a bag of IV fluids and nausea medication before the chemo started. My first round was probably the easiest with the fatigue. But the hardest for nausea. It hit about day 3 or 4. I only ate watermelon and pretzels. After the first round we found out what nausea meds worked. By day seven I felt better.",372,0,0,"['start', 'so', 'young', 'non', 'smoker', 'lung', 'cancer', 'targetable', 'dna', 'mutation', 'i', 'but', 'and', 'good', 'chance', 'treated', 'specific', 'medications', 'i', 'think', 'took', 'month', 'bio', 'markers', 'come', 'back', 'it', 'long', 'waiti', 'sorry', 'teenage', 'lung', 'cancer', 'that', 'never', 'happen', 'it', '’', 'fair', 'i', '38', 'i', 'diagnosed', 'still', 'young', 'lung', 'cancer', 'pediatric', 'ask', 'oncologist', 'talk', 'social', 'worker', 'they', 'get', 'touch', 'support', 'groups', 'i', 'found', 'lot', 'comfort', 'group', 'there', 'women', 'i', 'met', 'via', 'tiktok', 'also', '30s', 'lung', 'canceri', 'ate', 'pretzels', 'watermelon', 'week', 'chemo', 'it', 'causes', 'really', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'so', 'i', '’', 'much', 'appetitei', '39', 'i', 'chemo', 'lung', 'cancer', 'it', 'wiped', 'days', '36', 'i', 'would', 'take', 'multiple', 'naps', 'day', 'i', 'would', 'purchase', 'urinal', 'amazon', 'incase', 'fatigue', 'chemo', 'makes', 'hard', 'dad', 'get', 'bathroom', 'also', 'doctors', 'prescribed', 'walker', 'or', 'maybe', 'useful', 'take', 'back', 'office', 'first', 'week', 'post', 'chemo', 'has', 'tried', 'sleeping', 'wedge', 'pillow', 'google', 'pills', 'acid', 'reflex', 'that', 'might', 'help', 'keep', 'upright', 'let', 'stretch', 'bed', 'i', 'glad', 'drinking', 'water', 'chemo', 'change', 'taste', 'buds', 'week', 'two', 'so', 'water', 'may', 'taste', 'bad', 'buy', 'flavored', 'water', 'packets', 'don', '’', 'stock', 'anything', 'pre', 'chemo', 'i', 'also', 'lived', 'alone', 'i', 'bought', 'i', 'thought', 'i', 'would', 'want', 'eat', 'i', 'stomach', 'but', 'taste', 'i', '’', 'want', 'made', 'hate', 'taste', 'yellow', 'gatoraid', 'which', 'favorite', 'i', 'able', 'drink', 'blue', 'flavor', 'i', 'normally', '’', 'like', 'if', 'already', 'really', 'bad', 'eating', 'might', 'want', 'look', 'continuous', 'glucose', 'monitor', 'see', 'would', 'wear', 'that', 'way', 'see', 'sugar', 'going', 'low', 'eatingask', 'pain', 'medication', 'home', 'use', 'surgery', 'my', 'surgeon', 'refused', 'treat', 'pain', 'opioids', 'after', 'two', 'three', 'weeks', 'unbearable', 'pain', 'friend', 'suggested', 'i', 'reach', 'oncologist', 'she', 'issue', 'treating', 'pain', 'use', 'incentive', 'spirometer', 'and', 'walk', 'sleeping', 'uncomfortable', 'make', 'sure', 'comfy', 'pillows', 'different', 'sizes', 'help', 'find', 'position', 'comforti', '38', 'i', 'diagnosed', 'non', 'smoker', 'i', 'wish', 'i', 'could', 'blame', 'stress', 'but', '’', 'know', '’', 'commoni', 'lobectomy', 'lung', 'cancer', 'i', 'never', 'offered', 'radiation', 'i', 'glad', 'tumor', 'removed', 'i', 'also', 'like', '20', 'lymph', 'nodes', 'removed', 'biopsiedthe', 'chemo', 'days', 'infusion', 'center', 'almost', 'day', 'be', 'prepared', 'hurry', 'wait', 'usually', 'access', 'port', 'draw', 'labs', 'wait', 'lab', 'results', 'then', 'wait', 'drugs', 'prepared', 'my', 'oncologist', 'would', 'hydrate', 'bag', 'iv', 'fluids', 'nausea', 'medication', 'chemo', 'started', 'my', 'first', 'round', 'probably', 'easiest', 'fatigue', 'but', 'hardest', 'nausea', 'it', 'hit', 'day', '3', '4', 'i', 'ate', 'watermelon', 'pretzels', 'after', 'first', 'round', 'found', 'nausea', 'meds', 'worked', 'by', 'day', 'seven', 'i', 'felt', 'better', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,"['fatigue', 'pain']",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Chemotherapy', 'Radiation Therapy']",carcinoma

It was a massive shock to all of us but in many ways probably better for her than suffering through months of treatment that might only have prolonged her suffering. She had been very fit and healthy right up until 3 months before diagnosis and she kept getting the brush off from her doctors - they told her it was a chest infection, sinus infection, arthritis potentially. Eventually a rheumatologist sent her for scans and that’s when it was caught. I’m so sorry you are all going through this. I wish your mum a peaceful passing.I’m so sorry to hear this. My mum had what she and her doctors seemed to think were recurrent sinus and chest infections. She was on antibiotics on and off for 4 months. She started getting joint pain so was finally referred to a rheumatologist who thought she might have an autoimmune disorder and sent her for scans - lung cancer that had already spread to her bones. She was sent for a brain scan too as she was having excruciating headaches but we never got the results of that because unfortunately she passed away from (mainly) pneumonia just 4 weeks after that original scan. Immunotherapy was what the oncologists were talking about as her best chance though and it gave one of my friends and extra 15 months after she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer with brain and bone mets.

It was metastatic lung cancer. he chose to get off treatment and he moved out of the US to Greece and drank red wine, ate healthy Greek food and worked in the vineyards. Since that diagnosis he is still alive 40+ years later. Miracles do happen. Follow your heart. Your higher self knows best. Everybody‘s cancer is unique and different. They’re alternative remedies, that you can take that that destroys cancer. As I said miracles do happen and I think a power greater than ourselves is in control. Spirituality is very important to me. I hate the Targeted therapy pills that I’m taking that have left me pretty much a homebody. I don’t work out anymore and I’m gaining so much weight. Currently, I’m suffering from acute inflammation where I have so much pain all over my body. Also these pharmaceuticals mess with brain chemistry so we have brain fog and we don’t think as sharply as we used to. I’ve had a little bit of chemotherapy and I hated the effect two days after when I felt like just killing myself. What chemotherapy does to the body is horrible. I think Western medicine sucks. And the science community as well. This day and age they should have something much better that can eradicate cancer. But chemotherapy and the targeted therapies are BIG money makers for big Pharma. My Oncologist stated that I have up to seven years to live. I laugh at that. How do they know?? They are not God.

649,SympathyDapper6719,"I am sorry it only took 8 weeks. That is so fast, it must be so hard to process. Your experience is very similar to what happened with my mom. I took her to the ER on 1/26/24 for hip pain and swelling on her side that she thought was a hernia, they did a CT scan and found masses all throughout her abdomen. It was so shocking to hear after sitting in the ER for 6 hours awaiting the likely news that she would need hernia surgery. Turns out there was no hernia, it was a giant mass. She was admitted and after MRIs and tests, stage IV lung cancer with 30+ tiny brain metastases. The outlook was optimistic from the oncology team, considering how advanced her disease was. They gave her a year and a half. She did targeted radiation for the brain tumors and got through 2 chemo treatments (w/ immunotherapy). She did have the biomarker testing and qualified for a trial, which she didn't live long enough to participate in. She passed on 4/16, on my birthday. It only took 12 weeks. She started to decline from day 1 of diagnosis, losing the ability to walk, use the bathroom, see, think/talk clearly, etc. The chemo/immuno was working on the disease in her body, but the damage to her brain was too great. Turns out she was having mini strokes, despite being on Eliquis, which really baffled the Doctors. Just before we got that last piece of news, she had decided she was done with treatment. She was only on hospice for 6 days. I share my story to show that you are not alone. This monster of a disease is wreaking havoc on many of us. I am haunted by my thoughts of what I could've done differently if I had known she would be gone so quickly. It helps for me to share these thoughts with people I trust or in a forum like this. If I don't, I feel consumed by it. I've also learned that setting aside some time where you plan to just feel the pain helps my ability to focus on tasks (like work or kid stuff) during other times. If my grief is triggered by a thought or memory, I remind myself that I can explore that more during my planned time. Sometimes I include my 11 y/o daughter in these planned times (they were super close). We look at pictures and videos of her or we ""talk"" to her like she is in the room, giving her updates on life stuff and telling her what we miss about her.

686,TrashPandaNotACat,"I'm sorry you and your mom are dealing with this. You're right to be concerned about the back pain. My father's lung cancer spread to his spine. Regular CT and PET scans are very important during treatment and after.I was in a similar position - stage 1a3 tumor in left upper lobe, deemed nonoperable due to diminished lung capacity in right lung from emphysema. Treated with radiation, all signs point to tumor killed, and offered spot in immunotherapy clinical trial to see about using durvalumab to prevent reoccurance. Mine is a double blind study, where I dont know if I'm getting the placebo or the real drug. I opted to do it, despite the possible side effects, because it can come back and because it means they'll be keeping a much closer eye on me than if I wasnt in trial. I get a CT more frequently, PET scans more frequently, and meet with oncologist more frequently. Because of this more frequent testing, we caught 2 large colon polyps right before they became cancerous (they lit up on PET scan, but were declared precancerous when removed and tested). So, that keeping a closer eye on things has already paid off (I'm a little over a year into the trial). Is the flying to Houston every 4 weeks for my clinical trial a bit of a pain? Yes.

730,Wyde1340,"Yes, it's normal. It took a month before treatment started for me (2 months from 1st symptom). Sometimes they'll start someone on immunotherapy or chemo if the biomarkers take too long to come back.I was dx Stage 4 squamous when I was 47 so I'm a little older. Mine was inoperable. You don't mention if you've had biomarker testing. If not, I'd get it done. I ended up having a biomarker (MET amplification). I've been on targeted therapy and stable for over 5 years. I haven't had to do any chemo yet.Stable is good!!I'm sorry you're going through this, but try to hold on to hope. There is a lot of research going on and you never know when the next best thing will come out (in the Lung Cancer world, we say we just have to live until the next drug/treatment comes out). Keep yourself educated on what's going on...advocate for yourself and support others newly diagnosed. Honestly, I think those 3 things are have what kept me going. Anyway, a couple of moms in our support groups have started to write (or record) letters to their babies. Another started an Instagram with their children's name and started taking pics of them together every day, with little snippets of information.Stage 4 squamous here. I was dx in December 2018 and doing well. I do have a biomarker known as MET. So, If he has non-small cell, make sure he gets biomarker testing (Next Generation Sequencing), not just the test for the ones they have targeted therapies for. I'm sorry you're going through this. It's awful and treatment may suck, but there is hope. Not sure if you're a Facebook user, but there are support groups over there with more people.I was dx December 2018 Stage 4 squamous non-small cell with MET amplification biomarker. I'm doing very well on targeted therapy. I have no side effects now (I did when I first started, but onco gave me meds then reduced my dosage). Trust me when I say this: I was close to death...in a wheelchair, dependent on others, wearing diapers. Then I started the targeted therapy. Within 2 weeks, I was able to function again. I know not everyone will have this outcome, but please let her know there's hope.I don't know if you're a Facebook user, but there are a ton of support groups there. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1643271995958004/?ref=share&mibextid=qtnXGe EGFR Resisters: https://www.facebook.com/groups/EGFRResisters/?ref=share&mibextid=qtnXGe I've seen papers that EGFR is fairly common in Asian women, but I don't know enough about it. I am currently an Imerman Angel to an Asian woman, around your Mom's age, with EGFR as well. I have squamous nsclc with MET mutation and I've been stable for over 5 years.

777,bdpna,"Wow, what a fantastic answer. So sorry to hear about your mom as well. That has to be very stressful to do all that traveling and be so far away but wow, what a fantastic kid you are. Unfortunately, my dad has not been sleeping much at night since getting the lung cancer. The primary tumor is so close to his esophagus that he has constant phlegm that is exacerbated when he tries to lay horizontal. Anything but sitting up right in the chair and he has problems. It has been really hard to watch. So maybe one positive side effect if he gets tired enough is that he will actually get real sleep. Much like your mom, my dad was celebrating losing weight before his diagnosis. Since then he has been trying to eat, but it has been a real struggle. Unfortunately, we haven’t found much that he enjoys as everything is tasteless and struggle to put down with no desire. I’m a little concerned about this so will continue to do my best to advocate that he eat even when it is the last thing on his mind. Thanks so much for that. My dad sounds a lot like your mom and his doctor meetings. I have been in every single meeting and the one asking most of the questions. My dad‘s doctor is also a little older and seems to have the clinical approach, but not really a lot of additional bedside manner. My dad doesn’t mind as he is the same way. I prefer a little more detail from the doctor and not the feeling like he’s rushing to get to the next patient or the next thing.that said, I’m pretty well schooled on what my dad has, at least more than I was a month ago. I sure do ask a lot of questions and hope to continue to ask the right ones when given the opportunity. Your mom is very lucky to have your dad. I do wish someone could always be there with him, but given him my sister’s family commitments and my work commitments that is just not a practical thing right now. We are going to do our best to be there in person as much as possible and via technology every single day. My very best wishes to you and your family during this difficult time.Thanks for the reply, my best wishes to you and your Mom in this rough time. It sure has been a stressful summer.Wow sounds like she is tolerating very well! The eating and movement are big things. My dad struggles in both now so hoping the treatment may change that for him at least during the non tired days. Wishing Continued good progress to your mom!!!Well, the day is here. I'll try and keep a journal here or start a new post if it feels more helpful. My sister is taking him to the first treatment today and we are alternating. I'll be spending several days living with him after he gets home today. From what we hear the first day and night are not bad but anywhere up to ""day 5"" (I assume treatment counts as ""day 1"") can be the worst of it, so I want to be there. Since he lives an hour away from each of us but wants to be home, this was our best plan we could devise. We are thankful for the schedule of 3 weeks between treatments though realize this means he'll be getting a lot today, so we are hoping for the best but ready for the worst with side effects. I'll share that stuff here when I get a chance, just hoping that we are ready. Ironically (probably by design) Dad had the best 2 days since diagnosis this week, the palliative radiation given to the lung tumor finally got his cough and phlegm under control, took 2 more weeks past the last treatment to finally start giving results, so it is true that radiation keeps working many weeks or even months (TBD?) after it ends. Of course, after those good 2 days he's right back into the dumps with the chemo starting today. Our biggest concerns are if he will have issues with bathroom activities (that has been a struggle between constipation and the other extreme) and his weight loss continues at about 3 pounds per week due to lack of appetite. We're expecting him to mostly just want to sleep and be inactive during the first week of each chemo cycle. So it will be a challenge to get him to drink and eat if he is mostly sleeping. And then we are of course hopeful to avoid the nausea. I will post more when I can in the days ahead, any feedback always helpful. Also hoping this post can be useful to any others down the road who are going through a similar medicine combo.As promised here's an update. We are on day 5 after the first infusion. Figure I can leave this all here, helpful to those who may find it later, as other posts on history of treatments have helped us to get ready. So due to the steroid he had a great day at treatment, they treated him well with meds and comfort in a massage chair and snacks. He enjoyed the day very much and ""loved"" chemo. Ha! He had a huge energy burst that lasted the next 2-3 days after treatment due to steroids in the IV as well as the pills. We are on day 5 now and this is the start of the ""crash"". I will note the palliative radiation to his primary in his chest finally started to have positive effects just before the chemo which helped resolve his cough and appetite somewhat. So that plus the steroids, he has been able to return to bed to sleep and eating/drinking while nowhere near regular levels did increase. He tried some normal non-sugar food and was able to get some down also was able to drink way more fluids after chemo. Which I hope will help. Top two issues on day 5, constipation which has been a problem for a while now, we are trying to work on it via a once daily stool softener as well as a laxative pill. We will talk to the docs if these OTC meds do not work. Second side effect started setting in yesterday that is getting worse today is muscle pain and some neuropathy. He is having some trouble walking and having to be VERY careful. Muscle pain was so bad he was unable to sleep last night. We are going to try and manage with OTC tylenol but if it gets no better or worse with the pain and inability to sleep we'll talk to the doc. That's where we are on day 5. My hope is that we have a few rough days and then he gets some better more normal days in the 21 day cycle. Then it starts all over again for at least 5 more treatments. Will try and keep this post updated. As always welcome any comments or questions.More updates, again for anyone interested who finds this thread later or anyone with questions or comments now. Dad had second infusion on Friday, this time added Zometa for bone strengthening, the Keytruda, The Taxol (a 3 hour infusion) and the Carboplatin. The taxol is the most brutal of the bunch from what I am reading, with the carboplatin not far behind. Hair loss began about 2 weeks in, still some hair at week 3 but lots falling out as we start the second infusion at 21 days. Infusion days are easy due to steroid given during the process. The mediport worked well. During his nadir visit (halfway between first and second chemo) the white blood cell count was low as well as hemoglobin, came up in time for the second infusion. Doctor said something about needing a blood transfusion if it gets worse future times. Doctor also said he wants to CT scan the cancer areas after the 3rd treatment (9-10 weeks after first chemo) to check progress, since we are not yet seeing any signs of improvement (although I am unsure if we are supposed to, this soon either). Dad continues to have better days than others, big side effects are the following: Sleep disrupted, he sleeps when he can, often an hour here and there throughout the day, thus is not ready for bed at night and is often up half of the night. Cannot sleep on a bed but somehow can sleep on a recliner for an hour, and on a couch on his side for a few hours. We are not sure why this is. Appetite remains awful as ever, except on chemo infusion day when the steroid makes him more hungry and briefly improves taste. Otherwise most food has the wet cardboard sensation and his body rejects swallowing it, thus, eating very little and strength is very low, walking short distances has become a challenge from lack of strength as well as being out of breath The palliative radiation did cure his blood and mucous cough but the cough did return in a more dry fashion here and there for now. The lung was the primary so I guess this is the way it will be,. Constipation, rock hard stools for the first days / week after a chemo infusion. Trying to start stool softeners to manage. Neuropathy in hands fingers is pretty bothersome, also was in feet a bit, doc says Taxol causes this and lowered the dose a bit. Extreme fatigue and low feeling after the steroid pills stop being taken around day 5/6. No nausea at this point which we are at least thankful for. Fairly few words during the low days, on the high days, a lot more talking or communication, often with some repeated stuff or brain fog which may be due to some of the meds the palliative team provided to try and stimulate appetite or promote sleep (but do not seem to be working). Aggression or argumentative state can be a mix, less so on high days / steroid time, more energy and movement but often frantic or erratic. During low days, very quiet and mean. MAJOR pain in his tailbone which doc thinks is a pressure sore due to constant time in chair, not broken open yet but skin is thin there so we have concerns. Not managing with any pain meds other than tylenol which does not work. He did say pain went away after starting steroids. So it likely will return in a few days. That's about where we are at here at the three week mark. Next week, we expect the big crash and then have another Nadir visit to check his bloodwork, and an appointment with palliative care. I may ask for medical THC gummies which are approved in this state, before we move to any opioid type stuff. No other plans right now other than the horrible wait for scans after the 3rd chemo, from being here I know to expect the worst, hope for the best, but am ready for any outcome and then the doc's recommendations. Any questions let me know. I can try to answer.",1012,0,0,"['start', 'wow', 'fantastic', 'answer', 'so', 'sorry', 'hear', 'mom', 'well', 'that', 'stressful', 'traveling', 'far', 'away', 'wow', 'fantastic', 'kid',

791,briarwren,"I'm so sorry, and my thoughts are with you. This is normal, although I know it's incredibly hard waiting at first. Just be there for your mother to support her as well as possible, ensure there is someone to act as a scribe at her appointments, and don't bother with Dr. Google. You don't have enough info, and you'll only overwhelm yourself with the numbers. I speak from both sides of the fence. My mother has Stage IV small cell), and we found out completely by accident early last year when it metastasized to her brain and landed her in the ER. She had had no symptoms. We weren't shocked per se about the cancer itself since she's smoked for over 50 years, and my grandmother also had lung cancer. What we were shocked about was that it was such a late stage with no discernible symptoms. She had brain surgery and radiation to treat what was left in the brain and then began immunotherapy Optiva and Yrvoy. They moved fast, but I think she only had her brain surgery as quickly as she did because it was life-threatening. It's been 15 months, and she's doing well, although still on the Optiva. I saw her newest scan compared with the original one recently. The bit still left in her brain is ""dead,"" her other mets are gone, and the lung mass is demonstratively smaller with none of the junk it was originally surrounded with. When it gets a bit smaller, her doctor is planning more targeted radiation. Myself however, am a completely different story. We discovered I have Stage IV colon cancer completely by accident just after I turned 40. I also landed in the ER with pain they thought at first was appendicitis; if only! That was early December, and I didn't begin treatment until February. There is no colon cancer anywhere in my family. I was super healthy. I ate well, rarely drank, didn't smoke, and regularly walked 100+ miles a month with my dog. I had absolutely no symptoms that would have caught my doctor's attention enough to call for an early colonoscopy. I did have a few small ones, but nothing abnormal for my age group that wasn't typically easily cared for, such as perhaps taking a bit more fiber for constipation. I'm almost three years on and am doing reasonably well. My scans are clear, and I find out Thursday if I can suspend my chemo again after a recurrence, so fingers crossed.I'm so sorry. My thoughts are with you and yours, and the candles are lit. My mom is similar; brain mets with small cell lung cancer. We found out a year ago the beginning of May. She had a fast growing tumor that was barely a month old but was causing immense pain. At the time, she'd been fighting to schedule spinal surgery for degenerative disk disease. She was ignoring the pain and not letting us know how bad it actually was. I live almost two hours away, so she was able to play it off over the phone, but my SIL stopped by and managed to bully my strong-willed mother to the ER, which shows how bad it was. She was placed on meds and kept under observation to control the growth, had brain surgery a couple of weeks later, and they were able to remove the vast majority of it. Apparently, it was a close thing. She didn't have a stroke, but she could have, and the doctor said if she hadn't come in when she did, she would be gone. She had several radiation sessions for her brain, got her port, and then healed a bit before beginning her immunotherapy. She was on Optivo and Yrvoy every two weeks (treatments alternated between one and both), although recently, it's just Optivo since her doctor is happy with her current scans. I was with her when he compared the very first lung scan to her most recent one. It was demonstratively smaller and had none of the original junk around it. The doctor said when it reduced by half? (can't recall exactly) again, he would do targeted radiation. The tiny bit left in her head is still dead and not growing, and the other mets are gone.",395,0,0,"['start', 'im', 'sorry', 'thoughts', 'this', 'normal', 'although', 'i', 'know', 'incredibly', 'hard', 'waiting', 'first', 'just', 'mother', 'support', 'well', 'possible', 'ensure', 'someone', 'act', 'scribe', 'appointments', 'dont', 'bother', 'dr', 'google', 'you', 'dont', 'enough', 'info', 'youll', 'overwhelm', 'numbers', 'i', 'speak', 'sides', 'fence', 'my', 'mother', 'stage', 'iv', 'small', 'cell', 'found', 'completely', 'accident', 'early', 'last', 'year', 'metastasized', 'brain', 'landed', 'er', 'she', 'symptoms', 'we', 'werent', 'shocked', 'per', 'se', 'cancer', 'since', 'shes', 'smoked', '50', 'years', 'grandmother', 'also', 'lung', 'cancer', 'what', 'shocked', 'late', 'stage', 'discernible', 'symptoms', 'she', 'brain', 'surgery', 'radiation', 'treat', 'left', 'brain', 'began', 'immunotherapy', 'optiva', 'yrvoy', 'they', 'moved', 'fast', 'i', 'think', 'brain', 'surgery', 'quickly', 'lifethreatening', 'its', '15', 'months', 'shes', 'well', 'although', 'still', 'optiva', 'i', 'saw', 'newest', 'scan', 'compared', 'original', 'one', 'recently', 'the', 'bit', 'still', 'left', 'brain', 'dead', 'mets', 'gone', 'lung', 'mass', 'demonstratively', 'smaller', 'none', 'junk', 'originally', 'surrounded', 'when', 'gets', 'bit', 'smaller', 'doctor', 'planning', 'targeted', 'radiation', 'myself', 'however', 'completely', 'different', 'story', 'we', 'discovered', 'i', 'stage', 'iv', 'colon', 'cancer', 'completely', 'accident', 'i', 'turned', '40', 'i', 'also', 'landed', 'er', 'pain', 'thought', 'first', 'appendicitis', 'that', 'early', 'december', 'i', 'didnt', 'begin', 'treatment', 'february', 'there', 'colon', 'cancer', 'anywhere', 'family', 'i', 'super', 'healthy', 'i', 'ate', 'well', 'rarely', 'drank', 'didnt', 'smoke', 'regularly', 'walked', '100', 'miles', 'month', 'dog', 'i', 'absolutely', 'symptoms', 'would', 'caught', 'doctors', 'attention', 'enough', 'call', 'early', 'colonoscopy', 'i', 'small', 'ones', 'nothing', 'abnormal', 'age', 'group', 'wasnt', 'typically', 'easily', 'cared', 'perhaps', 'taking', 'bit', 'fiber', 'constipation', 'im', 'almost', 'three', 'years', 'reasonably', 'well', 'my', 'scans', 'clear', 'i', 'find', 'thursday', 'i', 'suspend', 'chemo', 'recurrence', 'fingers', 'crossedim', 'sorry', 'my', 'thoughts', 'candles', 'lit', 'my', 'mom', 'similar', 'brain', 'mets', 'small', 'cell', 'lung', 'cancer', 'we', 'found', 'year', 'ago', 'beginning', 'may', 'she', 'fast', 'growing', 'tumor', 'barely', 'month', 'old', 'causing', 'immense', 'pain', 'at', 'time', 'shed', 'fighting', 'schedule', 'spinal', 'surgery', 'degenerative', 'disk', 'disease', 'she', 'ignoring', 'pain', 'letting', 'us', 'know', 'bad', 'actually', 'i', 'live', 'almost', 'two', 'hours', 'away', 'able', 'play', 'phone', 'sil', 'stopped', 'managed', 'bully', 'strongwilled', 'mother', 'er', 'shows', 'bad', 'she', 'placed', 'meds', 'kept', 'observation', 'control', 'growth', 'brain', 'surgery', 'couple', 'weeks', 'later', 'able', 'remove', 'vast', 'majority', 'apparently', 'close', 'thing', 'she', 'didnt', 'stroke', 'could', 'doctor', 'said', 'hadnt', 'come', 'would', 'gone', 'she', 'several', 'radiation', 'sessions', 'brain', 'got', 'port', 'healed', 'bit', 'beginning', 'immunotherapy', 'she', 'optivo', 'yrvoy', 'every', 'two', 'weeks', 'treatments', 'alternated', 'one', 'although', 'recently', 'optivo', 'since', 'doctor', 'happy', 'current', 'scans', 'i', 'compared', 'first', 'lung', 'scan', 'recent', 'one', 'it', 'demonstratively', 'smaller', 'none', 'original', 'junk', 'around', 'the', 'doctor', 'said', 'reduced', 'half', 'cant', 'recall', 'exactly', 'would', 'targeted', 'radiation', 'the', 'tiny', 'bit', 'left', 'head', 'still', 'dead', 'growing', 'mets', 'gone', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,"['pain', 'chronic constipation']",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Surgery', 'Chemotherapy', 'Targeted Therapy', 'Radiation Therapy']",carcinoma
812,coffee_riot_148,"Stage 4 lung cancer here. Had a melanoma on my toe and that digit got hacked off but not before the cells traveled into my lungs. Now I have a mass the size of a kiwi fruit and some smaller nodules too. Starting immunotherapy on Wednesday. I'm being treated at Virginia Commonwealth University's Massey Cancer Center and they're keeping me positive. My oncologist is very professional and never gave me a vibe of doom. Chemo kind of freaked me out because it's basically a poison. Immunotherapy was the only recommended therapy (for the time being) because it's a drug that boosts your own immune system into hyperdrive.It's one IV that takes 30 minutes and it's a monthly dose. I'm 51, so maybe age and health is a factor, but doc said after some time and constant monitoring adjustments can be made and there are clinical studies I could enter. At no time did my team tell me how bad it is, nor my chance of survival, or a time period left to live and I like it that way. Since Day 1 of my diagnosis (June 17) I'VE held onto the PMA (positive mental outlook). That's all I can do under the circumstances. My only advice for you while your father undergoes this cancer shit-show is to reach out to him, tell him you love him all the time and make him talk about his feelings, Try to carve out a bit of time here and there. Especially once the real shit starts. Even if it's just dropping off a meal.

Similar to baby formula or protein milkshakes. They don't have much of a taste, some flavors like strawberry, banana or vanilla. Good luck with your dad's treatment.My heart goes out to you. I have been through pretty much the same, my dad had stage 4 lung cancer and doctors told me he has 6 months to a year left to live. His appetite was good until the last week, he had trouble breathing and standing for a minute was hard for him. He had taken two rounds of chemo but never had nausea or lost his appetite. On his last week, he started to get nausea and he threw up everything he ate. On a Friday, he went into ICU, they told me I couldn't see him until Monday due to not having enough personnel on call for weekends, and at 3am on Monday the hospital called me. Till that call, I still had hoped to see him on Monday. My advice to you is, Just stay with her. You may never be able to guess the time so spend as much time as you can with her. I'm sorry you are going through this.Mom(65) had the same surgery, she had problems with her kidneys so all pain relief they gave her was some paracetamol. After the surgery, she walked a lot on the hospital corridors, her doctors told her to blow baloons and cough a lot to expand her lungs and prevent liquid built up in her lungs. She had a slight break on one of her ribs and powered through with only Paracetamol. She had x-rays twice a day to examine the lung capacity. Everything went OK and she was sent home in 5 days. She had 3 sessions of preventative chemo. They monitor her now every 3 months with CT scans and MRIs.Her lung have expanded beautifully, and she has less problem breathing and more energy now that she had to quit smoking.

937,magicpenny,"I completely understand where you’re coming from. I had a friend who had adrenal cancer, her treatment was very difficult but she reached remission. Then it came back. She refused treatment the second time and passed away a few months later. I told my husband if that happened to me I probably wouldn’t go through the initial treatment because I didn’t want to suffer like that. Then I got cancer. A completely different cancer, multiple myeloma. It’s very treatable but there’s no cure yet and I’ll be taking medication the rest of my life for it. Things are okay right now. But, I still refuse to suffer. When I reach that point, I will be faced with the same decision you are facing now. You’re very brave to even consider it. This decision should only be about you. Don’t allow yourself to suffer to keep anyone else happy.This is me. I became extra sensitive to all adhesives after lung cancer surgery when the surgeon closed my incisions with dermabond. I let my providers know and they use paper tape or coban wrap. It’s still inconvenient. I’ve had other procedures where the provider didn’t listen and used derma bond while I was sedated. That was pretty horrible. Unfortunately, it’s just something we have to deal with. It sucks, but it won’t kill you.Of all the stupid things I’ve ever imagined someone might say to me about having cancer (also a blood cancer), denying there’s such a thing as blood cancer has never crossed my mind.

Good news and great updates are always welcome.I lost both parents to lung cancer. I was 16 when my dad passed, 54 with my mom. With mom it was a horrible rollercoaster ride, only time has lessened the acuteness of the pain.Is a remote second opinion possible in Canada?Please know that the Duropean Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO- https://www.esmo.org/) recommends lung cancer surgery only with curative intent. Another group you made guy want to connect with is LuCE-https://www.lungcancereurope.eu/. An organization for patients and caregivers.Chemo works because it destroys fast growing cells. That includes the tastebuds as well as hair, cilia, and bone marrow. One thing that may help with flavor of foods is using bamboo or plastic utensils to eat. -platin drugs make everything taste metallic, using an alternate helps offset that. Barleydogmom mentioned appetite stimulants. There are several that have been approved for patients like your dad, in addition to the Mirtazapine, your doctor might consider megace or marinol. Both are artificial canabinoids and FDA approved, insurance should cover them. If you live in a medical marijuana state, talk to a licensed dispensary about which CBD might be appropriate. Experiment with flavors. Things he used to love, he'll hate. Things he used to hate he may enjoy. The platinum drug he's receiving can only be taken 4-6 times. Their effect will wear off and his appetite should return.My stage 4 lung cancer was diagnosed almost 14 years ago. This is no longer the automatic death sentence it once was. There are two organizations I can recommend that have peer support people available for both the patient and others for the caregivers. The Cancer Support Community/Gilda's Clubs have support groups for patients and another for caregivers, family and friends. Peer support groups https://www.cancersupportcommunity.org/find-location-near-you https://go2.org/resources-and-support/emotional-support/phone-buddy/ https://www.lungevity.org/for-patients-caregivers/support-services/peer-to-peer-mentoring/lifeline-support-partnersDana Farber has Nurse Navigators, if this was me, I would get in contact with that person and get their help getting those answers. That's part of their job description.Each of us here is today because someone, somewhere in time had a treatment or a surgery not knowing if the outcome would mean survival or not. You have to decide if you want to pay it forward or not. No judgement either way. As you said, do you want to risk side effects for no benefit or is it possible that other new cancers could result from your 40 year history and you might be preventing them? It's a very difficult decision and should not be made lightly.Those papers are quite accurate.

Fred Hutch also supports Integrative Medicine, and Seattle probably has other complimentary/alternative therapies available. Also, buy or borrow the book ""Radical Remission"" by Kelly Turner. I had stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer but mine just had tumors in my lungs on both sides, not to distant organs, so definitely not as serious as your dad's. I was diagnosed in 2013, had chemo, surgery, radiation, chemo again, chemo once more, and finally SBRT radiation, and have scanned tumor free since 2015. I also did a TON of alternative and complimentary therapies. I was relatively young (53) and in general good health when diagnosed, so that helped as well. My surgery was at UW Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and my care there was excellent. Additional advice: keep a notebook with detailed notes of every office visit and several copies of all test results and scans. This will be REALLY helpful when your dad gets 2nd and 3rd opinions. Your dad will definitely get better care if you, or his spouse, or another friend or family member works as his advocate.

1011,pilarofsociety,"This is so wonderful. I’m really happy for you ❤️My mum (65) was diagnosed two months ago with stage 4 NSCLC (adenocarcinoma). It was a huge shock as she’s a non-smoker and has always been quite healthy. I’d strongly recommend a biopsy with genetic testing if that’s not already been requested. Some lung cancers occur due to a genetic mutation (like EGFR) and there’s targeted treatment available (Tagrisso for EGFR) that’s highly effective for most patients with such mutation. Stage 4 cancer is a lot to deal with, but I can say our family is in a much better place now than at the start, when there was so much uncertainty, fear, and not knowing how to navigate through it all. You will work it out together. Sending you strength.Really sorry to hear about your mum. I have a similar story. My mum went to see the doctor about back pain a couple of months ago and was diagnosed with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer that’s metastasised to the spine. The biopsy results will be very important because if she has certain gene mutations she can have targeted treatment (like Tagrisso for EGFR mutation) that can be effective for a while with few side effects. There are people who have taken Tagrisso for years on Reddit and other forums. So make sure they do genetic testing as part of the biopsy. I’d advise against reading the survival stats online. The data is mostly very old, before the availability of targeted treatment. The data also doesn’t separate by age, so you have 80/90 year olds who were near the end alongside much younger people. Sending you strength ❤️Wonderful news, thank you for sharing the positivity, and wishing you continued progress.Thank you, I really appreciate this. What was the trajectory like in the days after starting radio, e.g. did you feel worse before feeling better? She has bone destruction at c5 and L5. I just want her to feel a bit better so she can see there is hope.Thank you for your story, that gives me a lot of hope.She’s in NI and it’s public holidays until Tuesday frustratingly. She was told maybe she’ll see the oncologist a week later, but it’s very vague. I’m very frustrated by the whole process (NHS) but appreciate it can be a whole lot worse.Thank you, I’m glad you’re feeling better. They’re doing the gene mutation testing and I’m hopeful for EGFR as she’s an east Asian non-smoker. I just need to get that oncologist appt asap.Thanks for your reply. I’m in EGFR resisters and it’s very informative. This is for when we have the exact mutation information - but is there a resource on prognosis by mutation? For example, the prognosis for those with mutations that can be targeted must be better than for those without.Thank you for this. Did they say prognosis for Tagrisso is 5 years?UPDATE: My mum saw her oncologist today who said she has EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation, plus a rare ILE706THR mutation. She’s starting Tagrisso next week assuming her blood tests are normal. The doctor said Tagrisso works on average for 2 years but varies. In the circumstances, I think this is positive. I hope everyone else is doing ok.Thank you, same to you ❤️Thanks so much for this. What did the doctor say to you about the prognosis, if you don’t mind me asking? My mum is such a trooper too. So unnecessarily. She won’t even take paracetamol during the day, so she does take something for night time.Thank you for this. It’s comforting.

1036,rollerG12,"Thank you and best of luck!I don’t have any biomarkers. My cancer is KRAS mutated.Sorry you’re experiencing this…I just want to say, that side effects are not always cumulative and everybody is different. My first round of chemo was also the hardest, yet I just finished cycle 5 of 6 and this past cycle was the easiest so far. It was almost like my body had a tough time for the first round because the chemo was so foreign to my body, but it adjusted overtime. It might be tough all of the way through. Take it a day at a time. Dont worry about the 8+ more rounds, just get through today. Do that over and over again, and eventually you will be done. Anything worth doing is difficult.Well said. I struggled with the notion of “fighting” at first. I thought about the people who are so sick at the time of their diagnosis that they don’t even get the chance to “fight” and we would never say that they didn’t “fight” or “gave up” or whatever, so I keep thinking to myself how on earth can we call it a fight when it seems like luck/random for those who even get an opportunity to see treatment and have a chance to survive…I almost felt like calling it “fighting” was a slap in the face to those who don’t have a chance to “fight”… Then I came to my own conclusion that fighting is just continuing on with cancer. Whether it’s showing up to work every day, or laying in a hospital bed. Whether you feel great or you’re encumbered by intense pain. The second that you realize that you have cancer, your fight begins whether you know it or not, and no matter what you decide your plan of action/treatment (or lack there of) will be. Much love. Stay strong out there 💪.28 with stage 4 lung cancerSeriously. I got my last scan results back within 3 hours.I feel pretty good, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I was told that I’m early in treatment so we aren’t even necessarily expecting shrinkage because the immunotherapy may not have had enough time to begin working yet. So I am very happy to see a response already, I am hoping that this is a good sign for long term results. Second, through my lung cancer journey I have been reading about how new genetic mutations and targeted therapy are “changing the game” for lung cancer treatment and how it’s saving lives. However, I have found way less hopeful insight around treatment for patients that do not have these targetable mutations, and I do not have any of these mutations so I was worried that treatment would be less effective for me. I almost felt left out and like I had less hope. I am hoping that I will have some continued success with treatment and can provide hope for patients who don’t have targeted therapy and have to stick with the standard chemo/immunotherapy. Overall, we are not out of the woods yet, but for how early I am in treatment I think this is a very good response and we wouldn’t be expecting much more this early on based on what I discussed with my care team.",307,0,0,"['start', 'thank', 'best', 'lucki', '’', 'biomarkers', 'my', 'cancer', 'kras', 'mutatedsorry', '’', 'experiencing', 'this…i', 'want', 'say', 'side', 'effects', 'always', 'cumulative', 'everybody', 'different', 'my', 'first', 'round', 'chemo', 'also', 'hardest', 'yet', 'i', 'finished', 'cycle', '5', '6', 'past', 'cycle', 'easiest', 'far', 'it', 'almost', 'like', 'body', 'tough', 'time', 'first', 'round', 'chemo', 'foreign', 'body', 'adjusted', 'overtime', 'it', 'might', 'tough', 'way', 'take', 'day', 'time', 'dont', 'worry', '8', 'rounds', 'get', 'today', 'do', 'eventually', 'done', 'anything', 'worth', 'difficultwell', 'said', 'i', 'struggled', 'notion', '“', 'fighting', '”', 'first', 'i', 'thought', 'people', 'sick', 'time', 'diagnosis', '’', 'even', 'get', 'chance', '“', 'fight', '”', 'would', 'never', 'say', '’', '“', 'fight', '”', '“', 'gave', '”', 'whatever', 'i', 'keep', 'thinking', 'earth', 'call', 'fight', 'seems', 'like', 'luckrandom', 'even', 'get', 'opportunity', 'see', 'treatment', 'chance', 'survive…i', 'almost', 'felt', 'like', 'calling', '“', 'fighting', '”', 'slap', 'face', '’', 'chance', '“', 'fight', '”', '…', 'then', 'i', 'came', 'conclusion', 'fighting', 'continuing', 'cancer', 'whether', '’', 'showing', 'work', 'every', 'day', 'laying', 'hospital', 'bed', 'whether', 'feel', 'great', '’', 'encumbered', 'intense', 'pain', 'the', 'second', 'realize', 'cancer', 'fight', 'begins', 'whether', 'know', 'matter', 'decide', 'plan', 'actiontreatment', 'lack', 'much', 'love', 'stay', 'strong', '💪28', 'stage', '4', 'lung', 'cancerseriously', 'i', 'got', 'last', 'scan', 'results', 'back', 'within', '3', 'hoursi', 'feel', 'pretty', 'good', 'couple', 'reasons', 'firstly', 'i', 'told', 'i', '’', 'early', 'treatment', '’', 'even', 'necessarily', 'expecting', 'shrinkage', 'immunotherapy', 'may', 'enough', 'time', 'begin', 'working', 'yet', 'so', 'i', 'happy', 'see', 'response', 'already', 'i', 'hoping', 'good', 'sign', 'long', 'term', 'results', 'second', 'lung', 'cancer', 'journey', 'i', 'reading', 'new', 'genetic', 'mutations', 'targeted', 'therapy', '“', 'changing', 'game', '”', 'lung', 'cancer', 'treatment', '’', 'saving', 'lives', 'however', 'i', 'found', 'way', 'less', 'hopeful', 'insight', 'around', 'treatment', 'patients', 'targetable', 'mutations', 'i', 'mutations', 'i', 'worried', 'treatment', 'would', 'less', 'effective', 'i', 'almost', 'felt', 'left', 'like', 'i', 'less', 'hope', 'i', 'hoping', 'i', 'continued', 'success', 'treatment', 'provide', 'hope', 'patients', '’', 'targeted', 'therapy', 'stick', 'standard', 'chemoimmunotherapy', 'overall', 'woods', 'yet', 'early', 'i', 'treatment', 'i', 'think', 'good', 'response', '’', 'expecting', 'much', 'early', 'based', 'i', 'discussed', 'care', 'team', 'end']",lung cancer,เล่าทั้งสองเพศ,ไม่ระบุเพศ,เล่าประสบการณ์ตัวเอง,non,['pain'],0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,"['Targeted Therapy', 'Chemotherapy']",carcinoma

1062,smartypants333,"February of 2021 my appendix burst. While they were scanning for that they said ""Huh, we see a little something here in your lung. It's probably nothing, but you should probably get it checked out when you get out of the hospital."" Got it checked out, it was stage 1 lung cancer. While they were doing the scans for that so they could remove the lower right lobe of my lung (April) they found a brain tumor. ""It's not cancer, but it still needs to come out."" So after I recovered from my lung surgery, I had brain surgery in June. They said that I was cancer free at that point, but it came back stage 4 (in my bones) 18 months later (Sept 2022).I was let go because I personally had cancer, and requested to continue to work from home for 3 additional months (in 2021 when Covid was still in full effect!) Companies aren't messing around with this RTO BS. And although I probably could have sued, I didn't want to waste my time. If I didn't sign away my right to sue they wouldn't give me my 2 months severance.I got ""the button"" for the 3 days I was in the hospital after my lobectomy. The nurse was also nice enough to set it up so the end would light up when I could have another dose. I was in a lot of pain, and it didn't get a whole lot better once I got home, but unlike some have said, my doctors did gave me opioid pain meds. My oncology team also refilled my prescription anytime I ask. I've been VERY careful not to ""dose up.""I was diagnosed stage 1 in 2021 (age 43), had surgery (to remove the lower right lobe of my lung) and was told I was cancer free. It recurred 18 months later (2022), stage 4, now in my bones and the pleural lining. I am going to say, that for me, I'm experiencing the absolute blessing that is modern medicine. I hesitate to say blessing because I'm not religious. My cancer has a genetic mutation that can be blocked with a targeted treatment. A single pill I take every day that has minimal side effects. I haven't had any chemo or radiation. I have CT scans every 3 months, and as of my last scans, I have no progression. The drug works on average 3-10 years until you become resistant. The hope being that they come up with something even better before that happens (maybe the cancer vaccine?)
