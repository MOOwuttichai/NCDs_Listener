Upbeat_Simple_2499,"Not offensive. Great reminder, actually. I'm still blessed enough to have a journey. Thank you 🙏🏻"
Quick-Employment-229,"I'm also from India and I relate with what you have written here. I got my diagnosis over a month ago for a rare subtype of lymphoma and have been hit with a visceral sense of our privilege, our ability to afford this second chance at life. So many people in our country cannot afford it, it is surreal. I worry sometimes that if my cancer comes back, I may not have access to the new immunotherapy drugs and trials that people discuss here as further lines of treatment. But we are catching up in the bigger cities with the treatments. I am grateful that I have access to a relatively new chemo protocol. Wishing you luck in your journey."
dirkwoods,"Gratitude squared. Well put. I see so much suffering that seems related to the false dichotomy- ""I have cancer, I might die"" and ""if I cure the cancer I won't die"". If we start with the assumption that being born means suffering and dying then it is just about what we do with the interstitium. I am so happy for you that you woke up and are choosing gratitude and joy for the time between these realities. It is the only sane response to our mortal reality."
ChaoticBoltzmann,"Why would this be offensive? I came here to remind myself of death and how things can change on a coin flip ... take it easy, I hope you pull through, you sound like a wonderful person."
alien__0G,"Lot of people get insecure when their privilege gets brought up, I’m guessing"
patatonix,"I entered the journey with this very gratitude in mind and because of things happening —your fiancee leaving had to be incredibly hard, I was traumatised by some friends who simply didn't care— it was eroded over time. I want to be able to develop it again, gratitude is a muscle or so I'm better off thinking. Thanks for sharing. People are amazing at surviving, psychologically speaking. If only we built a better world in terms of equality."
aethervortex389,Please insist on getting your Vitamin D levels checked.
Celticlady47,??? Are you in the right post???
Past_Badger,"Aww!!! I’m so happy she’s cancer free!!! That’s very good that you stayed very persistent, you’re a great parent. My son got his port removed a year ago so I know how you feel. Wishing you all the best. God Bless!!! Edit: the doctor said I couldn’t have my son’s port! :-("

Sea-Prompt-7305,I had no idea it was purple I don’t think they ever said what kind of port (or I just don’t remember) it’s so pretty!
ShoppingHot4314,Yes 👍🏽 that’s wonderful and I’d and will but I can’t have mine taken out but there’s a problem and heard there’s a lawsuit and that purpose and who knows what can happen in years to come I think we all should be able to keep it I just want to say I’m so so happy for your daughter and you momma. Excellent news for me today as had an mri yesterday and my pcp said there’s spots 🍄and wants to see me Tuesday 😩. MRI was just to bring to the surgeon to see the progression of degenerative disc disease and they’ve never done it with dye but Mpn blood clot and breast cancer last yr I’ve had it with all this. I’ll tellyalllllll. But no child deserves this stuff and I am so happy for her 😘😘😘
Unlucky-Nobody,"Grants! Mine hasn't been used in 6 months, but they don't want to take it out yet. I hope I reach this day."

Flimsy_Figure7880,"I had the same, stage 2 diagnosed Jan 2023, 6 rounds of chemo and I was done in July 2023. Still haven't got my port out, I'm about to do that, good luck and wishing y'all the best!"
Ok_Act7808,"I recall getting mine out and it felt so wonderful. While it is such an amazing device, having each slight discomfort gone is so freeing. I pray for you all this is a chapter closed to never reopen. I am 55 had a long journey with breast cancer 7/2020 and now 7/2024 have some symptoms and find I am end stage liver cancer and a rare incurable type. I know the thoughts inside my head but I can’t imagine what a child must feel not understanding all that adults do. God bless your child and may nothing but good health surround you all 💕"
FearlessUse6394,Oh wow is big I thought they were made of plastic or are they? Sorry you been through that
FearlessUse6394,I think they get recycled
gabsterspams,such a great feeling. i’m so happy for you. live your life <3
kyricus,"I'm so sorry you are going thru this. It's a common story, unfortunately. My wife went through something similar, she has stage 4 rectal cancer and for about a year before had been complaining to her doctor about pain in her rectum. It was diagnosed as hemorrhoids, then irritable bowel because she was having constant diarrhea, she was pretty much dismissed by her doctor. Finally, things got so bad we switched doctors and he immediately sent her in for a colonoscopy where it was discovered she had cancer. Had they done that back when the pain first started.... I understand the anger, I am angry for my wife, I am angry for you, I am tired of being angry. I wish you all the best."
aethervortex389,You should write letters to all of these incompetents quoting them and then tell them what your diagnosis was. Then tell them you're planning to sue. Doesn't matter that you're not. Make them sh*t bricks. Don't respond if they reply to you. Just leave it dangling. Too many horror stories of useless doctors. People shouldn't give them a free pass.
NP_huh,My fiancé and his mother sent stinker emails to all of them. The fact that his mother and one of the ENT docs were acquaintances was a coincidence. So no one we know will visit them ever again. They were just very apologetic and offering discounts. And were trying to get more involved post diagnosis. Which made me even angrier.
Aware-Marketing9946,"In 2015, I was blacking out. Then it happened while I was driving. By God's grace I didn't hit anything. 5 doctors. One guy, supposedly ""a top doc"" told me I had one particular condition...which I had already considered myself, but I knew I didn't fit the profile for. But ignore me he did. And I kept blacking out. Finally my physiatrist said ""I think you have severe stenosis"" (which I SUGGESTED TO ALL 5 DOCTORS, BUT WHAT DO I KNOW 🙄) MRI showed my spinal cord ""folded"" in 5 places. 3 discs missing. And other things. In total, my neck was ""broken"" in several places. How I managed to work, keep a huge garden and property, watch my grandkids....I have no idea. I ended up having an almost 8 hour surgery. Had a halo attached for 5 months. My neck is all metal and allograph. So much for being told: I had POTS I was ""post menopausal"" (gotta love that one) I was just ""anxious"" 🙄 I needed ""therapy"" It was ""hormones"". I was dehydrated. It was in my head. After 9 surgeries, 6 major, and decades of dealing with these medical people I just don't have patience anymore."
Terrible-Big-Baby888,"Sounds ideal but.. when you’re sick and exhausted and defeated and angry (but heavy on the sick part)… all of this is MORE energy being dispersed.. when you already have so little. I do wish that these acts would change things, but they hardly do. A lot of people recommended I go back and tell these doctors/APRNs off but I’m tired—I didn’t want to feel more exhausted after poppin off.. so idk, just wanted to share my two cents."
digitalgoddess99,I was overweight when I suddenly experienced a complete loss of appetite. I started losing weight at an alarming rate and went to the doctor right away. She told me I should be happy I was losing weight. After fighting for treatment I finally switched doctors and was right away diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer. The delay in treatment is why I'm having a double mastectomy next week. It was hell being dismissed when I knew something was really wrong. I'm sorry this happened to you. It's not right and it's not fair.
lumpytorta,I’m sorry you’re going through this.. as someone who was finally diagnosed at 28 I had a similar experience and was dealing with ongoing symptoms since I was 26. One doctor straight up told me to just take vitamin D when I told him I kept getting sick and my HR and BP shot up out of nowhere then he tried blaming it on my weight when I wasn’t even super overweight and I was very active. I was even blatantly misdiagnosed by the ER that found the primary tumor. It’s so frustrating because as females our pain is downplayed and we’re seen as over exaggerating but add in being young and we need to deal with the whole “you’re young you’re fine and can deal with it” doctor mindset too. It’s frustrating and I get so angry when I hear of people getting dismissed now. I’ve learned how to navigate through the healthcare system in a way no one should have to.
NP_huh,I hope you’re doing better now. It’s frustrating but I’m glad you’re getting the treatment you deserve.
DerkSC,Yeah. I have a friend who went in and out the hospital for 2 months before doctors just start suspecting that there may be cancer. By then he was already mentally drained.
Last_Course_8431,"I’m from Canada and our ER docs are kinda insane. So I showed up 4 times to the ER for fevers and general sickness (fever was 104 and rising bpm was 160+ so clearly very sick) buttt took me an hour to get a bed then even longer to be seen when I finally did get seen apparently I had strep (which I believe cus my cancer comes with that type of stuff). A few more visits after that included extreme weight loss, unexplained bruising and petechiae, hallucinations, low counts/ so many transfusions I can’t even count and high HR and scarily low BP. Anyway finally got this super sweet ER doc who saw me in the waiting room and immediately knew something was very wrong. An hour later I have leukaemia and I’m being shipped across the country for treatment. Took 5 months to get to that point, another month they said I would probably be dead. Me and that ER doc still chat, she checks in with me and asks how my treatment is, some (most) doctors are lazy and tired and just want the quickest and easiest solution and then get you outta there. It’s a fucked up system and has killed a lot of my family members because of the negligence. Wishing you well OP, it’s a tough battle and a long one but it’s always worth the fight."
driftingthroughtime,"This is unfortunately an all too common story. And, it’s even more frustrating because early detection is key AND you are paying attention to your body, so know something is wrong. Are there really that many hypochondriacs going through doctors offices? But, no! Healthcare in America is terrible. We would rather spend more money on treatment than prevention because statistically it is slightly cheaper. Anyway, good luck on your journey. It’s a shitty one."
Terrible-Big-Baby888,"Yep—always push and demand what you know you need. I had a similar experience being dismissed that everything I was experiencing was only side effects of medications I was on… again, until I couldn’t walk and was in so much pain I ended up at the ER too.. (I’m also in my early 30s). It makes me angry to think of how many times I was expressing symptoms of something going wrong and they dismissed it. I can 100% sympathize with you. I hope that the medicine continues to do what it needs to do to get everything under control. Moral of the story: only YOU know your body best so KEEP FIGHTING FOR YOU! Nobody else will!!!"
CartographyWho,"Around the world, it seems that women in pain are not taken seriously. As told by someone earlier here, rectal cancer apparently doesn't get diagnosed in younger women because GP's go on the haemorrhoids and IBS route rather than getting a colonoscopy done. That's how most rectal cancers only get diagnosed when they're at stage IV already. I find it unacceptable that women get shipped off with a prescription for Preparation H and dietary or lifestyle advice, when we know that's not what's going on. When I finally got a colonoscopy, I was lucky to only have a large benign tumour in my rectum. Which was then removed and confirmed non cancerous. And I will need to have another colonoscopy in two years. Cancer sucks in all its forms. Some are more prevalent and should be caught earlier to give us a fighting chance. Sorry for ranting as this sort of story hits close to home and really gets me angry with our healthcare systems worldwide. Wishing everyone here a good day 😊"
EquipmentLive4770,Doctors absolutely sucks sometimes. I get it the majority of the time you hear hooves it's a horse but sometimes it's a zebra. That is the saying I heard a doctor use that can actually think outside the box. He misdiagnosed a patient that passed away because he just kept going with the typical diagnosis instead of digging a little bit and ever since has drastically changed how he works in his day to day. They absolutely should have listened to you and if you still see the same one absolutely give them shit
Ok-Mechanic-5128,I am sorry you went through this.
Fossilwench,"i too heard the "" you A types "" etc amidst the myriad of dismissals over the years until it couldnt be in its later stage. you're angry and so you should be. you're absolutely correct that we must be our strongest, loudest advocate even in the face of repeated dismissals. especially our demographic- women. sending you juju and love."
Blackata2,I'm so sorry to hear this. I recently lost my mum to a misdiagnosis. She passed away at the age of 61 and I'm pregnant with my first child. She badly wanted to be a grandmother. To say I'm angry with her oncologist is an understatement. I'm beyond furious. I lost the most important person in my life and now I have reached a point where I do not trust any doctors. She was dismissed when she kept complaining about her symptoms.
SufficientPickle2444,See a medical malpractice lawyer IMMEDIATELY
Aware-Marketing9946,"Oh dear. Every time I read something like this makes me glad I volunteered to be a patient advocate. (I am also a patient myself). This has happened to me so many times I keep boxing gloves in my purse. So I can come out swinging when you (doctor) tell me some kind of shit like what happened to you. I've no more time for being dismissed and ignored. The damn doctor works for us....boy they seem to forget that don't they? Do everything you can to learn about your health situation. Ignore doctor's who tell you NOT to ""look things up on the Internet"". Dammit any healthcare person says that to ME, they better duck. I'm not kidding. I got insulted, scorned, made fun of, matter of fact I've had docs break all their own rules and guidelines. Two male radiologists literally tag teamed me... my husband was mortified...you gotta be really dumb to do that especially in front of him. All because I insisted on knowing my risks. As it turns out, radiation was AT BEST only a 2% benefit to me. All this damage to my body, for what? I now tell everyone I see the truth. How to navigate this ""system"". This shitty, compromised, rotten so called medical care we have. We pay 20% of our income on healthcare. We in the US are ranked 24th. That's all you need to know. I will absolutely advocate for myself and others. A smart doctor sees this on my face, and does his job. In the end that is all I ask... Do your job. Help me. Be a partner with me in my betterment."
Motherscooters,Thank you for sharing your story!!! All of this will help the next person be more persistent than if they wouldn’t had read your story. You may be saving someone else’s life by writing this. Thank you 😊
Terrible-Big-Baby888,It sure is a fucked up system that has killed a lot of people. I’m not surprised it was a female doctor that finally listened (don’t care if I sound sexist..). And I’m also not surprised that you still talk with her. My breast surgeon saved my life and I tell her that alllllll the time. I would say she still saves my life because she advocates for me often. I’m happy to hear that you are alive today. And that someone did finally listen to you. It is scary when you hear how little time you could’ve had if you hadn’t been so persistent. I wish you the absolute best.
kitkatofthunder,"I’m sorry. That is really disgusting. I work with an amazing spine surgeon who is also trained in oncology. His approach is if we can’t explain something we never ignore it. Either we run more tests, imaging, or provide a referral to a specialty that might have more insight. 1. With your symptoms they should have provided you with a referral to neurology if they couldn’t find anything. 2. We can never say to anyone their symptoms are nothing. If they continue to follow-through with multiple appointments, tests, exams it means the symptoms are bothering them significantly. Each specialty has a very narrow perspective on the entirety of medicine, refer until you find it and continue follow-up to see if anything progresses, usually it doesn’t take long. 3. I hate to say it, but it doesn’t affect us at all to send for advanced imaging. It takes a few seconds for the order and if there is nothing it takes 2 minutes to read the images. If insurance fights, it sucks, but we wait 6 weeks then we send it again saying they continue to have pain and it will be approved. Denying imaging is just lazy. The only concern for imaging is sometimes we find things that are ambiguous and require further observation or tests."
NP_huh,"What bugs me is that the doctors I visited could have atleast guided me to the correct department if they didn’t know how to help me. It’s sad but when I finally was taken seriously and was in the MRI machine, I was hoping they would find something off with me, just so I could prove the previous doctors wrong."
ImprovementLazy1758,"This is horrible, completely horrible, and I too am very angry fwiw, on your behalf. What I’d like to know is, did you have the severe headaches, loss of facial sensation, disequilibrium and relative but persistent loss of motor skills, did you have all of these even BEFORE you were taken seriously? In other words, were you being dismissed even with these symptoms? If so that is medically unconscionable."
NP_huh,"Unfortunately, yes. I was dismissed even with the symptoms. I was prescribed basic painkillers and told to take it easy. Until one day when I couldn’t bear the pain anymore and had to rush to the ER."
Marta_Smarta,"I wasn't taken seriously either. My family doctor kept telling me my severe vaginal bleeding/clotting was hormonal, or IUD related. She would say my pap smears are fine so the pain and bleeding was just normal. When I say bleeding, I mean out of nowhere it would gush out and I'd need a complete change of clothes from the waist down. This went on for about a year when I was put under to ""find"" the missing IUD. Surgeon found cervical cancer tumor which he biopsied. I was staged 2B. Went through the radiation, chemo, and internal radiation (barbaric, actually). I don't think the tumor ever died but doctors kept telling me MRI was just picking up necrotic tissue. This was in 2019. In 2023 I was getting very short of breath. I told my oncologist about that and he said, there's no way it's cancer spread but if I feel better, I can go down and get an X-ray. Results came in, tumor pushing on lung, now collapsed lung. Also paralyzed my vocal chords because the phrenic nerve was being pressed for too long. Now I'm stage 4B because the cervical cancer metastasized. Went through a gruelling year of treatments that only kept the tumor stable. Now just on immunotherapy and targeted therapy, which is also giving bad side effects. Doctors are very quick to dismiss patients. My husband said we should try and sue the initial family doctor, but I know nothing would have come of it. Just a ton of stress. She's retired now, so hopefully won't harm anyone else with her dismissive attitude."
NP_huh,I’m so sorry you had to go through this. I hope you’re getting the correct course of treatment now. Sending good luck!
BetterNowThks,"i'm sorry you experienced this reality is this is most of our stories. I suggest filing grievances with all of the related organizations. Like everybody. Writing a letter to the provider doesn't do anything. If they are reported to their governing organizations, that sometimes, sometimes makes a difference. The bottom line is that these doctors are trained to ignore women's pain and discomfort. We are all considered crazy or attention seeking. another way to go would be a lawsuit, but it's such a slog. Definitely file grievances. Wherever you can find something that says ""to file a grievance"" - then do that."
drevoluti0n,"I had the inverse. Went to the hospital for what felt like broken-spine levels of pain and was dismissed and accused of drug seeking. After 6 months of seeing a pain specialist who had every test done he could think of, a scan looking for something completely different found my stage IV blood cancer. Hospital kept telling me they ""don't do diagnostics"" when I felt like I was in an active emergency. One tech put my IV in wrong and told me it couldn't possibly be worse than the tattoo I have near the same spot. I have been in the ER and listened to nurses loudly make fun of a patient who couldn't get to the bathroom on his own, and then immediately after heard an ER doctor reprimand a resident for taking too long with each patient. I know someone who specialized in orofacial pain management, and they have caught full on aneurysms in a person's neck that an emergency ENT dismissed as ""just jaw pain. Go see your dentist."" When they're good they're great, but when they're sub-par they're disastrously bad."
erinmarie777,"That’s very good advice and thank you for sharing your experience. It’s very understandable why you feel angry. I have distrust in many doctors myself. I’m sorry you have to experience such a traumatic disease. I’m glad you feel hopeful with the immunotherapy, and hope it smacks down all the pests. Sending healing thoughts. I’m angry for all the people who have been told not to worry about it when their bodies were giving them so many signals, and then turned out that they had cancer. There’s so many young people who have made videos about this story of being ignored, even for years, and then finally getting diagnosed. Why do doctors think they are so good at psychology? It makes me angry. They should do more tests but they don’t want to beg the insurance for “approval” because it’s so time consuming. I’ve heard them discussing this. So instead they seem to like to tell too many people that it’s all in their heads. Women get told that far too often. And black women are more likely to be ignored and die after childbirth because their complaints are ignored too often. We need to work harder on making this world a better place for everyone. It’s not nice sometimes in ways that are definitely wrong, but also just very unnecessary. Doctors need more time with patients and need to be allowed to do more testing. It shouldn’t take years to get an MRI when people have significant problems, they don’t know what it is causing it, but nothing works. I think we need more diagnostic specialists who can help people with finding out what is going wrong with them. Let’s get rid of insurance companies dictating how much time doctors can take and what tests they can do. Maybe the business model is corrupted too. Maybe they just want us coming back several times before ordering tests."
ViktorVaughn71,"Would you be willing to elaborate on your headaches and ear pain? Was it on/off or just fluctuation in severity, brain fog/memory issues, did they go hand in hand, etc. Prior to diagnosis, did the docs run blood work?"
CartographyWho,"You must have lost your way. Otherwise, you'd know not to ask such questions here."
WhodatSooner,I don’t know the lingo exactly but I have clear cell renal carcinoma. Is that RCC?
NP_huh,Yes. My report states it as metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma. My oncologists have been referring to it as RCC.
juroful,I’m so sorry those doctors treated you that way!! I went through a very similar situation. It was a 3 year battle of doctors telling me I was anemic until finally one night when I was very underweight and sick my body began failing me and I was rushed to ER. When I came to they told me I had a tumor in my chest that turned out to be Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Best of luck in your journey my friend!!! 🩵
NP_huh,Very sorry to hear what you went through. Good luck to you too. Hope we come out stronger on the other side of this.
47squirrels,I’m so sorry OP!! I was also dismissed by my doctor for 6 months for awful pain in my abdomen. My appendix burst and that spread my cancer all over my entire abdomen. It’s so hard not to stay angry. I still get pissed 19 years later.
yvettispaghettii,I wish we could put these damn drs on blast! I’m so sorry you’re going through this.
RequirementFit1128,"Same here, for a patient in their late 60's. The ""you young people"" didn't even apply. The 1st ER doctor sent them home with fucking Advil, when they couldn't sleep at night from pain. It took two months of being in and out of the ER until we tried a different ER where they finally saw how severe it was and admitted them. In two weeks they had more tests than in the 20 years prior. Many doctors suck, and you should absolutely press for more service and more consideration. Having a second person with you at the consultation helps to build up support and confidence to ask for more."
dirkwoods,"As a retired male physician my experience is that this is an unfortunate reality that is slowly changing and doesn't have any easy answers other than what you propose- advocate for yourself and be pleasantly pushy regarding further testing (""could you humor me doc and order a MRI of my brain for focal neurological symptoms that are otherwise unexplained?""). I had a rare but potentially serious neurologic disease that is frequently disregarded for weeks to months until it progresses and looks more classic. I called my doctor and advised him that I had a symmetric polyneuropathy that was starting to ascend and I was worried about the rare possibility of GB. Even the neurologist said, ""Oh, it's real!"" after doing my testing, but I wasn't blown off for weeks to months before they scheduled the testing. My wife almost punched the Neurologist when he said that btw. When I first started having metastatic cancer symptoms I was able to convince myself that they were statistically likely to be something else- until they progressed... The problem is as a human when you do 100 tests and 99 of them are negative you come to expect negative. In Emergency Medicine because the economic and other barriers are so high we tend to come at it from a ""prove to me you are well"" instead of ""prove to me you are sick"" perspective (that comes from patients bringing 10 complaints to a previously scheduled PCP appointment none of which go to a level of concern that would make them want to part with $500 for an ER visit co-pay). We way over-tested in the ER and we could easily spend the entire gross domestic product of this country and not meet all of our citizens' medical needs. We have the worst healthcare system in the world, until you visit the other 6 continents I have practiced on. You are right to be disappointed. It doesn't sound like you have personalized this at all. Hopefully my perspective helped a tiny bit."
natgastek67,You should look up Dr. Thomas Seyfried and his information.
PartisansArmes,"Sadly, there is a serious problem in medicine for women as they are often not treated with the necessary care and dilgence. This extends well beyond cancer. The best thing is to be a staunch advocate for your care and do not be afraid to speak up. The key like anything is to be respestful but firm. As ridiculous as this may sound, if you can bring a guy with you who will help with asking questions and advocating for you then absolutely do it. As a cancer patient, the last thing you should should be dealing is sexism. However unlike when we are healthy, the energy isn't there to deal with it and the bottomline is that you need the best care possible without having to wonder if your symptoms are being ignored and minimized."
Fit_Holiday_1049,"my oncologist didn't take me seriously either they just thought i wanted pain meds never was able to really get past that they gave me them for a few months then took me off even though i was in a lot of pain went to a pain specialist and was able to stay on Norco through ky whole cancer experience if thats what you want to call it then weined myself off of it slowly but they say I am in remission but pain hasn't really subsided it's still and at night it get so hard to sleep but whatever their the professionals but if you have some that witnesses what you are going through bring them with you and have them push the doctors to do something!!! good luck it gets worse before it gets better, unfortunately."
Fit_Holiday_1049,I dealt with stage 4 d/t cell lymphoma
1kSuns,"I wish this was less common. My daughter, now 27, was diagnosed with stage 4 mbc in November of 2021. 4 years prior she started bringing up that she had a lump in her breast to her primary care physician, who dismissed her by telling her she was too young for it to be anything serious. The next two visits where she came in to ask questions about the same lump were outright dismissed to the point where she didn't bring it up to anybody else because she felt she was making too big of a deal out of nothing. The next 4 years were filled with multiple incidences of symptoms that should have raised a red flag but every time she was written off because she was young. (And let's face it, female, which seems to be a pre-existing condition to being ignored by doctors) It's valid to be angry and frustrated, and I wish there was an actual solution to get people listened to by their medical providers."
medicinelou,"I am so sorry. My mom was diagnosed with brain cancer in March but almost didn't because her primary care doctor (also a woman) dismissed her physical symptoms as carpal tunnel/anxiety until my mom insisted on getting an MRI (there's brain cancer history in our family) and it revealed a huge tumor in her head, she had emergency surgery literally 3 days after the MRI. It's unbelievable that not advocating for yourself can literally kill you if you're a woman."
Patchouli061017,I’m sorry. Same with my dad. He has the EGFR mutation
briarwren,"I'm so sorry, and my thoughts are with you. This is normal, although I know it's incredibly hard waiting at first. Just be there for your mother to support her as well as possible, ensure there is someone to act as a scribe at her appointments, and don't bother with Dr. Google. You don't have enough info, and you'll only overwhelm yourself with the numbers. I speak from both sides of the fence. My mother has Stage IV small cell), and we found out completely by accident early last year when it metastasized to her brain and landed her in the ER. She had had no symptoms. We weren't shocked per se about the cancer itself since she's smoked for over 50 years, and my grandmother also had lung cancer. What we were shocked about was that it was such a late stage with no discernible symptoms. She had brain surgery and radiation to treat what was left in the brain and then began immunotherapy Optiva and Yrvoy. They moved fast, but I think she only had her brain surgery as quickly as she did because it was life-threatening. It's been 15 months, and she's doing well, although still on the Optiva. I saw her newest scan compared with the original one recently. The bit still left in her brain is ""dead,"" her other mets are gone, and the lung mass is demonstratively smaller with none of the junk it was originally surrounded with. When it gets a bit smaller, her doctor is planning more targeted radiation. Myself however, am a completely different story. We discovered I have Stage IV colon cancer completely by accident just after I turned 40. I also landed in the ER with pain they thought at first was appendicitis; if only! That was early December, and I didn't begin treatment until February. There is no colon cancer anywhere in my family. I was super healthy. I ate well, rarely drank, didn't smoke, and regularly walked 100+ miles a month with my dog. I had absolutely no symptoms that would have caught my doctor's attention enough to call for an early colonoscopy. I did have a few small ones, but nothing abnormal for my age group that wasn't typically easily cared for, such as perhaps taking a bit more fiber for constipation. I'm almost three years on and am doing reasonably well. My scans are clear, and I find out Thursday if I can suspend my chemo again after a recurrence, so fingers crossed."
Unlikely-Slide6402,"Holy hell. I feel for you and your mother, what a wild ride it has been for you guys. Wishing you the best, and that both you and your mom’s journey continues with great improvement! ♥️"
Wyde1340,"Yes, it's normal. It took a month before treatment started for me (2 months from 1st symptom). Sometimes they'll start someone on immunotherapy or chemo if the biomarkers take too long to come back."
WhatTheFushigi,"I’m in the same situation. I’m 51 and was diagnosed almost two years ago with stage 4 adenocarcinoma of left lung. I have never smoked in my life. I was stunned at first. It’s so unfair! And then you have to wait a couple of weeks after the biopsy to find out if you have any mutations. I know it’s a long, hard wait but it truly is important in how that treat the cancer. It sounds like they are actively searching for other causes of her symptoms and trying to treat her for those. Hang in there, it’s so difficult. I’m offering some unsolicited advice. You can take it or leave it! The best advice I can offer someone with cancer is to find a doctor you trust and then follow what they say. Stay away from Google. Just do what your doctor advises. They have years of experience that you will never be able to learn from Google. Don’t torture yourself with all that."
Party_Author_9337,"So most young non smoker with lung cancer have a targetable dna mutation. I did not. But most do. And if they do, there is a good chance that they can be treated with specific medications. I think it took about a month for my bio markers to come back. It was a long wait."
InclinationCompass,Testing for bio markers takes several weeks. There is not much your doctors can do until then. You will want the results and understand your options before deciding in treatment. This is normal.
puffedovenpancake,I’m so sorry. When I was diagnosed it took a week to get biomarkers back. I had a liquid biopsy. Because I was also a never smoker and a middle aged female they said I probably had a biomarker. Once they know the biomarker they can begin the correct treatment. I think it was about 3 weeks between an mri showing a tumor and when treatment started. I too was having issues (breathing and pain) that were getting worse. I had a pleural effusion that showed up on the mri and had to have it drained which helped a lot. Once treatment started I slowly started feeling a lot better over the next few weeks. It’s so frustrating and scary to wait. I look back and a lot of that time is a blur. I’m sorry you are here. Best wishes to your mom and you and your family.
c10bbersaurus,"I'm sorry for what you and your mom are going through. My dad had lung cancer, from smoking, survived for about 9 years with it. My mom beat breast cancer, only to succumb to pancreatic cancer, which was a rapid fucking thing. I hope and wish the best for both you and your mom. As long of a healthy life without suffering as possible. Fuck cancer."
missmypets,Waiting for biomarker information means they won't give her a treatment that is known not to work on her particular cancer. It will save her unnecessary side effects. Glad that you had that very important discussion and didn't walk away or deny her feelings and yours. Too often the patient's children don't listen. Thank you for that. Sending hope that a treatment plan comes swiftly and that it works quickly for her. Let us know what they offer and we can share experiences with any side effects.
Winter-Calendar6393,"I’m sorry about your mother. PLEASE! Get her home tested for RADON GAS! That’s a contributor to Lung Cancers, that no one ever talks about. It’s typically found in older homes. Especially those with basements. You would need to contact the city or environmental protection for a test kit."
jj0220220,I’m sorry to hear that about your mom. I was diagnosed with lung cancer almost 3 years ago. Definitely wait for the biomarker test if she can. Certain treatments work better and some treatments can actually make it worse depending on mutations. How long has it been since they tested? Tissue biopsy took about 8 days and blood biopsy took about two weeks for me.
SigChiScooby12,I'm assuming about a week. Her diagnosis from biopsy was last Monday. Her biggest issue is just breathing still. She's in ICU on 35ml and they can't get her off of it. That's Been Her life for 2 weekend now. Stuck in ICU. Her courage and bravery is still unmatched. She is my rock and my hero and Angel whenever the Lord wants her. She's ready and her faith is unmatched.
raykovskyy,same here no smoker. check before going in long term hike route after covid. like thunder in clear sky.
SigChiScooby12,I'm so sorry!!! Life just isn't fair. My thoughts and prayers are with you!
sizzlingtofu,Probably not the best comparison because my friend hadn’t been to the doctor in YEARS and was relatively healthy. She had a stroke out of the blue which they confirmed was caused from cancer clotting her blood and she died three weeks later. She had not really been eating a few months though and kind of keeping to herself about it. I would say when she hits a point where she does not want to eat at all that’s a sign the end is near. It’s tough if you’re taking meds that might affect appetite. She also had no pain. I think a cough but not severe she had smoked for 58 years and quit 3 months before this happened.
sizzlingtofu,Personally having sat with her everyday for her last 3 weeks I would recommend MAID. Especially the end looked very painful even with palliative care drugs
rheajanerob,Thanks for sharing. I agree not eating will be a tell tale sign. Interesting to hear she had no pain until it sounds like the very end. Because that’s what I think my mom is going through.
Previous_Basis8862,"My mum died 4 weeks after diagnosis of state 4 lung cancer. The rapid deterioration happened about a week after diagnosis when she contracted pneumonia. It was a massive shock to all of us but in many ways probably better for her than suffering through months of treatment that might only have prolonged her suffering. She had been very fit and healthy right up until 3 months before diagnosis and she kept getting the brush off from her doctors - they told her it was a chest infection, sinus infection, arthritis potentially. Eventually a rheumatologist sent her for scans and that’s when it was caught. I’m so sorry you are all going through this. I wish your mum a peaceful passing."
Purple_Olive_5358,"Hi, I'm sorry for your what your mom is going through, do you mind me asking which stage she was when first diagnosed? And the second time, how was it found that was in stage 4?"
whitet86,"My dad died fairly quickly after being diagnosed as stage 4. It became very difficult for him to breathe and he lost his appetite, and he died very shortly afterwards. I hope the MAID program will spare your mom fear and pain my father experienced."
HellaYeah650,"Please call or have her call the GO2 for Long Cancer helpline 1-800-298-2436, they will help you with anything lung cancer. We can help with clinic trials, second opinions, etc. Just call them and give your history, we can help."
rheajanerob,Thanks! Is this valid for Canadians?
Winter-Calendar6393,Hello. I’m 28F stage 4 NSCLC with Atrx mutation. I got a Lobectomy done (LLL) as well as a Lung resection (LUL) You’re right cancer is unpredictable. I ended up on a clinical trial- after failure with chemo and immunotherapy. When the cancer progressed I had a Tumor ablation (Aliya- PEF ablation) performed. So far the tumor is shrinking! My best advice considering your young age and being that you’re considered relatively healthy; your best bet is to get everything and anything done while your body can still handle it. At least that’s how my doctors and I are going about my prognosis
rollerG12,Thank you and best of luck!
Patchouli061017,Hi have you watched this webinar put on by YLCI and EGFR Resisters? It’s about surgery in stage 4 W MDA thoracic surgeon Dr Mara Antonoff https://youtu.be/TAwAvl5so1M?si=AZH2TaZh6MfjVnsv there is also some evidence that surgery in oligometastaic disease may improve outcomes
Wyde1340,"I was dx Stage 4 squamous when I was 47 so I'm a little older. Mine was inoperable. You don't mention if you've had biomarker testing. If not, I'd get it done. I ended up having a biomarker (MET amplification). I've been on targeted therapy and stable for over 5 years. I haven't had to do any chemo yet."
rollerG12,I don’t have any biomarkers. My cancer is KRAS mutated.
juiciestjuice10,"Hey mate, bit late to the party. I am stage 4a with very similar set up as you, with 1 largeish tumour(5×5) and a small number of little ones(not worth measuring). Oncologist is aiming for surgery for me, either by slowing going to radiation then surgery or just straight to surgery. I will still have chemo afterwards for I think 6 months"
WalkingHorse,This really breaks my heart. I feel for your mother and I feel your pain in the eloquent words you have written. I don’t know what to say other than just be there for her. And be gentle with yourself. It’s all so very hard. 🤍
missmypets,Find a hospice service that will help her move home.
ssjesses,"I’m so sorry this happened. Cancer sucks! Maybe she would be more comfortable at home, if she can be discharged."
Unlikely-Slide6402,"Oh, this is utterly heartbreaking. I’m so, so sorry, OP. The people that you are supposed to be able to trust with your life and care for you in the worst moments have let your mother down, and I absolutely hate that she will have that anger and regret instead of being able to make peace with it. I have no advice except maybe trying to find a second opinion if it isn’t too much of a hassle. I’m so sorry. 💔"
SaltyVinChip,"Thank you so much. We've had a few different opinions in the last few days but not by much.. one doctor said she had a few days, maybe weeks. A palliative care doctor said weeks. And her oncologist is the one saying he can maybe offer her treatment and she has a few months.. but my mom isn't eating or really even drinking so idk how she'll be offered chemo. She's super frail and in bed all day sleeping."
gl1ttercake,"I am so sorry. The PleurX and other brands of indwelling catheter can be associated with ""catheter tract metastasis"". I wonder if this is what was meant. My late father had the same kind of IPC and the implant site got infected with cellulitis, so it had to be removed. However, he wasn't draining much pleural fluid more and more often – if not for the infection, it was possible that he would have been able to achieve spontaneous pleurodesis. Is a talc or bleomycin pleurodesis a possibility (I'm suspecting not, given the performance status you're describing, the recovery can be brutal) or can they scar the pleura with silver nitrate? At the very least, she should be offered palliative radiation."
SaltyVinChip,"From what I know she can't get radiation but im not sure why. She also seems to be giving up hope. She doesn't want to go through any more procedures. I appreciate your knowledge and support.. I'll mention this to her, but I want her to stay in charge and I'm doubtful she will agree to anything else now."
Patchouli061017,This is so heart wrenching. My mom died a year ago from lung cancer.. today is her birthday and tomorrow is my daughter’s first birthday. I can viscerally feel the pain you and your mom are in. I am so so sorry 💔💔💔💔💔
SaltyVinChip,This is so hard. I'm sorry for your loss.
Affectionate_Bid1548,"Lost my aunt two weeks ago to lung cancer that metastasised to her breast, rib and spine. She was paralysed from waist down. She was diagnosed 5 days after initial paralysis after A&E sent her home to be literally carries/dragged by her son and daughter. I understand the heartache and anger all too well. She had asked her Dr, A&E and Out of hours for an X-ray in January because she was in excruciating pain and all three of them turned her away. Three months later she was paralysed from the waist down and non even three months after that she passed. Treatment wise there was nothing they could do, radiotherapy didn’t work and as she was immobile chemo wasn’t an option. She was in palliative care at home but had to spend almost two weeks in hospital after catching covid, e-coli in her urine etc. The Saturday before she passed she was taken into hospital by ambulance, the Dr wanted to keep her in but she wanted to go home so we took her home. She passed a week later at home surrounded by her loved ones. If your mum wants home take her home! If the hospital can’t help then there’s no need for her to be there. This disease is absolutely horrific and declines happen suddenly and quickly. Cherish every moment. We were told to expect between 4-6 months and she only lived four weeks. A few hours before she passed we were told another few days and she passed within hours. From what I’m reading, your mums condition is declining pretty quickly and it may be time to start closing the chapter. I know it’s so hard and I’m so so sorry you’re going through this. If you want someone to speak to a bit further, don’t hesitate to reach out. Take care of yourself, that’s important too!!"
Wonderful_Tower7494,"What good does it do being angry at your oncologists and care team? At the end of the day, they’ve saved your mums life many times over, and given you both more time than Mother Nature had planned. The reality is time is short and precious, why waste it being mad. Enjoy the moments you have, life is so beautiful, even at the end - it’s what gives it all purpose. I say this as the son of a terminal lung cancer mother, and I’m over being mad at her doctors for seemingly slow care, or being hard to reach, or not giving the right drug or blah blah. Cancer is mad complicated, stressful, unpredictable, awful. And the reality is everyone is doing their best, whether that is living a little longer, loving a little longer, or caring a little longer. Relax. Honestly, the outcome isn’t going to change by stressing about it. 🙏🏽"
SaltyVinChip,"Honestly I did appreciate this comment. I can't say I'm not still angry, I am, but I recited some of these things to my mom today. I would hate for her to die angry, even if she has the right too."
No_Cap_9561,You do not understand how emotions work. This is toxic and completely invalidating. Totally unhelpful and frankly heartless.
1eahmarie,It’s okay they missed a ton of cancer allover? Found the oncologist.
Sea_Art5876,"My heart breaks for you… I just lost my mom in June. She’s been fighting cancer for a long time. She had 3… & her body just gave out. She died in the hospital in front of me. We knew she was dying, we knew for years now. There’s no preparing, mentally, emotionally. All you can do is be there for her. It’s a tough. Spend time with her. Tell her how much you love her. My prayers are with you. I recommend grief therapy. It helps. 💔"
HellaYeah650,"Ugh I'm heart hurts for your mom, you, your family and friends. Please give the GO2 For Lung Cancer a call 1-800-298-2436, that is our HelpLine number. Tell them what is going on and we can help. I'll keep you all in my Prayers.🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼"
gtzbr478,"I'm so very sorry... that loss of trust in medical personnel is always a big blow, I see it so much in rare disease advocacy. It doesn't mean they're ""all bad"" or one can ""never"" trust a care team, but it does mean it's important to stay informed and know the professionals do make mistakes.I also know how difficult it is to be a squeaky wheel... and how it's even more difficult when it's not your decision (like when it's your mom who has to ask for more info, for example). I hope you can find a way to get palliative care at home for your mom. Sending hugs"
MamaBelleChat,"I’m sooooo sorry. I will pray for supernatural healing, peace & some sense of release that will help you both. (((( hugs and love ))))"
pilarofsociety,This is so wonderful. I’m really happy for you ❤️
WhatTheFushigi,This was great to read. I have a very similar diagnosis. I’m so glad she’s outperforming expectations!
BisonAltruistic7608,"This is great news! My dad was diagnosed around the same time with brain mets and did wbrt. Can I ask- is your mom’s mood a lot different? My dad did 10 rounds, everyday for 2 weeks with weekends off, of radiation and he now seems just not himself and is a lot angrier and also forgetful and can’t do things like he used to. His scans are clear so it isn’t the Mets, but wondering if you noticed anything similar?"
UsefulAirport,"Hi! How far out is he from the whole brain? My mom’s mood was really affected by the steroids she was on. She was on a full dose of them for almost a month to manage her brain swelling. Once she got tapered off it was another month of being on steroids. So basically two months or so on dexamethasone. The steroids REALLY affected her mood. She was snippier and less patient. More jittery and anxious. Angry at times. Once she was off the steroids her mood improved a lot (although chemo was another beast on top of that). Now that she’s off everything her mood is much better. Her memory is definitely affected. She struggles to keep track of new information, especially small stuff. Also she has been swapping the order of numbers around. She also finds it harder to communicate because people talk faster than her brain can process. I help her manage her schedule and organize appointments because information can just slip away from her. WBRT is definitely not easy but for my mom it was the right choice in the moment to stabilize her because she was so symptomatic from the brain swelling. She is definitely not 100% her old self but we are getting used to the new normal. She’s still my mom, just in a different season of her life."
MindlessParsley1446,Thank you for sharing this. I'm so happy to hear the encouraging update on your mom ❤️❤️❤️
ttbap,This is amazing news😊. Thank you for sharing. Inspiring and motivational for all of us. Good wishes to your mom and you♥️
missmypets,Thank you! Good news and great updates are always welcome.
Patchouli061017,I also came into contact with two other 18 year olds with ALK in the last few weeks. I don’t know why this is happening 😭
Vertical_shelf,"That’s interesting, where did you meet them? It’s very unusual for anyone under the age of 25 to have this disease so it’s quite surprising you’ve seen multiple. Are you a doctor or is it just online you’ve encountered us?"
Patchouli061017,Hi I’m so so sorry :( please consider checking out our young lung cancer Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/share/B5kWLi4EZ35RjCPb/?mibextid=K35XfP & check out YLCI.org as we are a new organization here to support younger people with lung cancer. 18 this is so unfair 😭
Icy_Dragonfly4280,"Just remember how far medicine has come. I remember being 13 taking care of my grandpa who was dying of it 27 years ago. He was a long time smoker. It's very possible in 5 years the treatment will be so much more improved. Keep the faith, keep living, and keep loving."
wisa88,Just wanted to say I’m impressed by your knowledge and your maturity. I’m hoping for best outcomes for you. I’m in the UK too and my ears are open if you ever want to vent or anything. One potential positive thing is if you do get many years who knows how much further we will be along with treatment by then. All you can do is take it one day at a time.
NOTHlSISPATRICK,Im 25 and got diagnosed last year December with stage 4. I know this sucks but don't give up hope. You are very lucky (I know that sounds dumb) to have ALK mutation and in 5-20 they may be able to cure lung cancer completely.
ZealousidealCareer52,"Just buy as much time as you can and stay strong. Huge strides are happening in medecin. So if you do get 10 years, your outcome might be completly diffrent, just because they cant cure it at the moment perhaps we will laugh about this in 10 years. (My mother just recently got diagnosen with stage 4 LC)"
Party_Author_9337,"I am sorry about your teenage lung cancer. That should never happen. It’s just not fair. I was 38 when I was diagnosed, which is still young for lung cancer but not pediatric. Ask your oncologist to talk to a social worker. They can get you in touch with support groups. I found a lot of comfort in this group. There are a few other women I have met via TikTok who are also in their 30s with lung cancer"
gtzbr478,I just wanted to say hang in there 🫶
Objective_Warning787,Did you have any symptoms? I’m 18 and I feel like I’m developing some sort of lung condition having smoked during highschool.
ResponsibleAd9364,"Well, I feel guilty about my 74 year old mom who smoked for over years getting it, I wish you the best care and life you can have. Stay strong"
Vertical_shelf,No guilt! Our struggles are absolute and not relative. Thank you for the support :)
scifieyes2276,"Condolences to you and your family. I've also experienced this with my aunt, we also thought it was a stroke but when we got her to the hospital it is confirned to be stage 4 lung cancer with brain mets. We only got 1 month before she was taken from us."
Mediocre_Tie7487,So sorry to hear that. Condolences to you. Your aunt is surely missed.
missmypets,"I lost both parents to lung cancer. I was 16 when my dad passed, 54 with my mom. With mom it was a horrible rollercoaster ride, only time has lessened the acuteness of the pain."
Mediocre_Tie7487,I can only imagine what it must have been like to lose both parents to the same disease. I am so sorry for what you must have felt as a 16 year old to lose your father. So young😔❤️
Chickadee108,I’m so sorry for your loss. I am only 18m out from losing my dad to colon cancer but as time goes on it is easier to remember him in his prime instead of how he was at the end. Our loved ones are always with us in one way or another ❤️
gtzbr478,My deepest condolences 🕊️
Independent-Maize-44,Im sorry for your loss.
Infinite_Purple1123,"I'm sorry. We lost my dad last year. Because he was insistent on treatment he got about 8 months. Had he not fought it would have been about the same. In 12 days he went from doing his lawn work and planting a garden to wheelchair bound. He was my superhero. It all still throws me when I think about it. I am so sorry you're living through this. It's awful when you get reminded of the mortality of your most loved people. You have my heart in this time. Peace in it's time, my friend. And comfort until peace takes hold."
WalkingHorse,🤍
Protection_Major,"My boyfriend just lost his cousin. She was 43. She went to the hospital so tired unable to walk, found a spot on her lung.. she went t unconscious and they did another scan and and found spots all over her lungs, stomach and brain. She had one massive tumor on her brain that moved and cause her to go. She didn’t even know."
SympathyDapper6719,"I am sorry it only took 8 weeks. That is so fast, it must be so hard to process. Your experience is very similar to what happened with my mom. I took her to the ER on 1/26/24 for hip pain and swelling on her side that she thought was a hernia, they did a CT scan and found masses all throughout her abdomen. It was so shocking to hear after sitting in the ER for 6 hours awaiting the likely news that she would need hernia surgery. Turns out there was no hernia, it was a giant mass. She was admitted and after MRIs and tests, stage IV lung cancer with 30+ tiny brain metastases. The outlook was optimistic from the oncology team, considering how advanced her disease was. They gave her a year and a half. She did targeted radiation for the brain tumors and got through 2 chemo treatments (w/ immunotherapy). She did have the biomarker testing and qualified for a trial, which she didn't live long enough to participate in. She passed on 4/16, on my birthday. It only took 12 weeks. She started to decline from day 1 of diagnosis, losing the ability to walk, use the bathroom, see, think/talk clearly, etc. The chemo/immuno was working on the disease in her body, but the damage to her brain was too great. Turns out she was having mini strokes, despite being on Eliquis, which really baffled the Doctors. Just before we got that last piece of news, she had decided she was done with treatment. She was only on hospice for 6 days. I share my story to show that you are not alone. This monster of a disease is wreaking havoc on many of us. I am haunted by my thoughts of what I could've done differently if I had known she would be gone so quickly. It helps for me to share these thoughts with people I trust or in a forum like this. If I don't, I feel consumed by it. I've also learned that setting aside some time where you plan to just feel the pain helps my ability to focus on tasks (like work or kid stuff) during other times. If my grief is triggered by a thought or memory, I remind myself that I can explore that more during my planned time. Sometimes I include my 11 y/o daughter in these planned times (they were super close). We look at pictures and videos of her or we ""talk"" to her like she is in the room, giving her updates on life stuff and telling her what we miss about her. I'm holding space for you in my thoughts!"
KieferSutherland,Condolences Reddit friend. My dad was diagnosed stage 4 about 2 months ago. 2 rounds of chemo so far. But it's everywhere. Going to see him for memorial Day. I can suddenly cry anytime I want. Life is tough and I hope the pain eases for you friend. I'll be joining you in your sorrow sooner than I'd like.
Mediocre_Tie7487,"Oh no, my heart aches for you. I know firsthand what it’s like and what you’re going thru. You are so lucky to still have your dad and be able to spend time with him. I’d give anything to be able to spend memorial day with my dad. Have fun and take lots of pics for memories🙂"
Ari-Hel,🤍🫂
endokodok,"My condolences to you. Similar to my mom, doctor o ly give 5 months. We thought only regular pain on her back and arm because too much house work, cleaning cooking or maybe wrong sleeping position. And she got stage 4b lung cancer already when first diagnosed and doctor said only 5 months to live."
Ari-Hel,My condolences OP. My mom only had 6 weeks when I took her to the hospital for what i thought was severe depression and initial dementia. Life is unfair. And I cry everyday for her. Little things keep me here now
margaretLS,"I am so sorry for your loss.Please be gentle with yourself for a bit.I lost both of my parents to lung cancer,18 months apart.I won't lie,there were days that i was drowning in grief and thought it would never get easier.It did and it does but the timeline isn't linear.You will think you are okay and then you aren't.That is OKAY!"
Gold-Soup9539,"Oh man, I’m so sorry to hear of your loss. May your Father rest well. A lot of advanced lung cancer patients in particular seem to pass extremely quickly after a diagnosis. My Grandfather died just two weeks after his diagnosis. We were told a month to three months at most. Similarly to your Dad, we also thought my Grandfather had a stroke. But no, it was metastatic brain tumours too. They found tumours basically everywhere they could’ve been found. Too late for any type of treatment. Was only in his 60s, and had just retired a year before after a long and hard 40+ years of work doing labour intensive jobs, so it should have been his time to put his feet up and enjoy the fruits of his labour… but no. It was heartbreaking. God, I hate this disease with a mighty passion. I hate how many people and how many families have to lose their lives/loved ones in this way because of it. Sending so much love to you. 🫶"

MrsBuckFutter,"Don’t give in to those thoughts. Fight through it. You know she doesn’t want you to follow her. Call your person. Go inpatient if you have to. It absolutely sucks, but life has more to offer you. Stick around to see what it is. I’m sorry for your loss. Hugs."
Specialist-Ear8277,Very sorry
aeon_floss,"Your words radiate pain and loss. I am so sorry you did not get more time. When you can find the words, please come back here and share something about your mother."
DemonCipher13,"Tomato soup. I used to love tomato soup. And, during and after chemo, it made me so, so sick, to even smell. It lasted about six months, but I waited two years before I tried another bowl. Just had some last night. Thankfully, it does go away. Use it as a time to try new foods, and maybe eat healthier. No better time than when your body can't say no. Or yes? Lol."
lumpytorta,lol I’m definitely eating a lot healthier as just the sight of anything greasy or sugary will make me want to gag. Like it makes me cringe almost if I take a bite out of anything too sweet or fatty. I love salty foods still though. During chemo I couldn’t eat anything warm/hot though because just the smells would trigger the nausea. I still get a bit of that now.
throwaway20383u281,"I had a phase during chemo where the only thing I could stomach was sushi. It's a shame you're not allowed to eat any raw fish during chemo, so I just ate avocado sushi for days on end. It did go away after a while luckily"
lumpytorta,Oof I wish I made that smart choice to have avocado sushi! I didn’t realize I was neutropenic already and thought I was ok to have a little bit of sushi at one point during chemo…boiii was I wronggg. I think that’s how I got e.coli and I was on the toilet for a week 😭
Educational_Web_764,"I have a few issues with eating to the point that I needed to get a feeding tube, but this is a huge issue for me with food right now. For the month of June, it was only watermelon and protein shakes. Now I can’t do either of those and went from watermelon to pickles and that was short lived. I went from that to popcorn and now I have no foods that I am like, I want to eat that. Toast is okay, but once I feel it has too much butter on it, I am done. I love s’mores every year as a summer treat. Tried two this summer and they both ended up back in the bonfire. Cherries I love. This year they are a hard pass. Bacon is now disgusting and I feel I might as well just work on being a vegetarian at this point in life. So many struggles."
lumpytorta,I feel you on the bacon 🫡 just touching my tongue to it was enough to trigger painful heartburn during my chemo days and the smell it left in the house was usually too strong for me to be around. What was it like having a feeding tube if you don’t mind me asking?? I think I almost reached that point because I couldn’t eat or drink anything for almost two weeks due to constant gagging and nausea so I’m curious.
BeeKayBabyCakes,"omg 😂 we are the same person 😩 everything sucks, except I can still eat watermelon"
LalahLovato,I couldn’t stomach avocados post chemo. There were quite a few foods I couldn’t eat. I had been on a keto diet and couldn’t stomach it during and am mostly turned off with it now. I had constant nausea from day 1 with radiation and chemo. I could smell something like rotting flesh/metallic - and still on occasion a year later - can still get a whiff in my brain.I basically survived on greek yogurt and frozen berries during
sentimentalsock,"Yes, and the smells. Things that I usually love to eat, can’t stand it. the exception being the first two days on steroids. Then I am ravenous."
RelationshipQuiet609,"I think this is such a big side effect from having treatment! I know foods I loved too I could no longer eat! Just the sight of them made me gag! I had to take anti nausea medication a lot just to eat. It does get better though, things seem to return to normal (somewhat normal)once you have finished treatment."
QuestoPresto,Chemo ruined garlic for me. I couldn’t eat anything with garlic during chemo and two years out I still don’t like a lot of garlic. But mushrooms for some reason tasted absolutely amazing during chemo.
Brandykat,"When I was going through chemo, I found that there was nothing I could eat or drink with the exception of Safeways chicken strips and pork sausage rolls, and dole juice. Everything else tasted rotten. Luckily it only lasted a few weeks past my last chemo. I lost a significant amount of weight during that time, probably about 40 pounds"
lumpytorta,I think it was McDonalds cheeseburgers that held me down for a bit when I couldn’t eat anything lol
maidenlush,"Dairy has been mostly off the menu since chemo. Cheese, cream sauces, it all makes me want to vomit. Even the smell will put me off. Mayo is also another one I can't stand. It's not dairy but everything about it just grosses me out now."
KnurledNut,"I'm on my 9th sequence of FOLFOX for colon cancer. Yes, the diet and taste go bonkers. Smells, tastes, textures, and general appetite will change...and drastically. Smoothies are your friend. Easy, and cheap to make at home. No crazy ingredients. This smoothie recipe will substitute for a meal. 3/4 cup frozen fruit (your choice) 1 scoop protein powder splash of water Blend like a madman Enjoy! I get my protein powder at Aldi. $20 for 2/lbs."
pfflynn,"Most tastes returned to normal but I still have some foods I used to love (hummus, for example) and now are just meh or worse. I’m about 9 months after my last chemo dose"
mixmates,"Right now I can eat ice cream, bananas, spaghetti, tacos and occasionally a bacon cheeseburger. It’s frustrating. I have two and half months of chemo left. Can’t wait for normalcy if it ever happens."
Danbannagaming,"I haven't even been able to think about any fast food since my chemo. I attributed it to the horrible food at the hospital (I was admitted for a week each treatment for 96 hr infusions). I gag just thinking about how awful and damp the food served in the hospital. The only thing I've been consistently been able to tolerate is chicken, and crispy chicken even more"
justlookingokgeez,"The smell of anything being cooked, especially meats, is particularly tough for me after chemo. Yesterday, I threw up because my mom made stir fry. Once it cools down, I can eat it just fine, but when it’s cooking, it’s like clockwork—I get so nauseous."
WhodatSooner,"Hahaha 😂. It’s like you are a different person. I’m a Cajun / Creole guy who loved Hatch Chile season and cooking paella with fresh rosemary and high quality saffron. My wife is a Laos chef so she makes a papaya salad that would buckle your knees and a Larp that would throw so many flavors and textures that you could eat it for days in a row and never get bored. And all of that is long gone. All of those subtle flavors and balanced ingredients- the freshness of good shrimp, the pop of cilantro in a ceviche? Bye bye."
Just_Dont88,Heavy foods. Greasy foods. I crave a lot of fruit now. Fruit juices. Soda not so much anymore. Chemo can really wreck the taste palette.
randomguy1972,Just about everything tasted like crayons or cardboard or cardboard colored with crayons while I was in chemo. I basically forced myself to eat just so I wouldn't starve.
Necessary_Spray_5217,"I think it’s fairly common and it will eventually go away. I was served cabbage during a hospital admit before I got nauseated and threw up. For many years, the smell of cabbage would make me nauseous, but I finally got over that. They would serve my food on a tray with pink food covers over the plates. After three or four hospital admits, I got nauseated by the site of the pink food covers. They placed an order in my chart to serve me my food in white Styrofoam containers after that and I did fine."
sarewr,"I just finished my last chemo so I don't know how long it last, but yes, I'm more picky now too. Chemo really messed up my taste and appetite. I also hate certain textures. And also if the food is too warm. In the summer I always loved eating tomato and mayo sandwiches and now I can't even think of them without feeling sick. My oncologist said it takes up to 6 months after chemo for the body to get back to normal. I hope that's true for taste too."
Cookielipz49,"That passed in time for me. After chemo/radiation I disliked alot of foods. I had a feeding tube for treatment as well as my cancer is in my neck. I jad to gain weight eating orally to get tube removed. A but of a bear since i dislike many foods, also, i’m in the, “Softer the better” food category these dats. Over time my over sensitivities about types of food faded. A ton of other acute symptoms from treatment faded over time as well. Sourceless bad smells, pungent urine, neuropathy in hands n feet, on and on. Time does heal- i encourage yku to move around/walk n exercise often. I believe this helped me move past many ugly side effects"
tabbyabby2020,Butter. I love toast with butter and jam. Now butter tastes strange. And things made with a lot of butter like pound cake also taste strange. I don’t like it. Cheese is also getting to taste strange but luckily it is still okay.
carterparben,Not much tasted good to me during chemo. Mayo was particularly gross to me. I never had issues with a little in a sandwich or tuna salad before. The only thing I craved were cheese burgers or hamburger patties but didn’t have them available to me most of the time. Good news the food aversions do eventually go away.
ferrouslights,I haven’t been able to drink sweet tea since I started my chemo regimen.
Effective_Bad_3478,"Yes, food tasted weird, but the worse was that I could not stand the taste of anything sweet. I would not eat it. The taste of the smallish amount of sugar added to condiments like ketchup and processed foods was magnified 10 fold and I couldn't eat it. Fruit tasted sweet, but didn't gross me out. I wouldn't say I had a crazy sweet tooth before chemo. I could stop at one cookie and be fine. Indulge once in a while, very mid, with the sugar thing before chemo. Chemo ruined sugar for me during very aggressive treatment for breast cancer. And the funny thing is, people would make me sweets to be nice. I just said thank you and threw it out later. I appreciated the kindness, but bleeck, couldn't eat it. I thought that I was going to be like that forever cause it took so long to get over it after chemo, like a year. But now I'm back to normal. I kinda wish that aversion would have stayed though as we all know we don't need processed sugar. I have yet to meet another cancer patient who had the same thing happen to them.."
Traditional_Fix7972,I couldn’t even eat hospital food after my first chemo
Fit_Holiday_1049,I did for a long time only smoothies were my go to
KitchenLab2536,"Had six months FOLFOX. While enduring the chemo, I’d promise myself that I’d have a great big steak to celebrate once chemo was finished. It was almost two months before my appetite returned and I had that steak.. During that time I could eat and keep down food, but didn’t enjoy it. Take heart, your appetite will return. 👍"
Still_Falcon9705,Yes. My husband is 2 months post chemo and just now getting his taste back to normal
Ok-Description-217,Everything I eat after my infusion pretty much needs to be bland. I tried to eat spaghetti bolonaise and it tasted gross! Too strong. I think because chemo kills fast dividing cells it nukes your tastebuds too. As a general rule i don't eat anything exotic i really love in the first week and come the second week I'm okay. I do love Tom yum soup though omg! I get that as my treat. McDonald's cheeseburgers too....
pugdaddykev,"Yes, and I was picky to begin with. I basically eat bland foods now like steak and potatoes or garlic noodles with ground chicken etc. but also drink a 600 calorie protein shake every day that is filled with fruit, veggies, nuts, and protein powder. It’s the only way for me to get a decently healthy 2000 cals in a day."
Yourmomkeepscalling,"I waited about a month and a half for my port to heal and feel normal-ish. I could totally go on rollercoaster after that, but less than two weeks after implant not a chance."
Infamous-Asparagus21,Good to know. I Can def go another time. I’d rather be safe than sorry. Some people say the port can dislodge on coasters. Is this true? Even after having it for months?
Hour_Change_2762,"I don't know if the rides would be safe or not, but I would definitely say it will be unlikely you will be able to ride rides with harnesses. You wouldn't want to have the port jostled up against the harness. I had my port placed in February of 2022. The procedure was super quick, as was recovery. However the area stayed tender for several weeks afterwards, and even after that, I was very aware that it was there for probaba year. Everyone is different. Wishing you the very best!"
Infamous-Asparagus21,"Thank you! People are saying to use lidocaine cream before accessing it, does that really work? Some are saying it’s painful to access some say it’s nothing"
wisteria_town,"Ports can dislodge afaik. But not easily. I was told by a nurse that one of the kids on my pedi ward was playing once and doing some tumbles or something. Her port was accessed & apparently it dislodged because of her movements. I wouldn't really risk it tbh. It probably wouldn't be comfortable either. I know I get uncomfortable on things like bumpy car rides with my port in place, even when it's not being accessed. Couldn't tell you about how painful port placement is since I was knocked out for mine. Moved around like a robot for 3 days. But afterwards the pain subsided and I had no more issues with it. Port access doesn't hurt either, I never needed any numbing cream or stuff. It's honestly less painful than getting a regular blood draw. Just a pinch at best, sometimes I'd wait for the nurse to access my port (put the needle in) like ""Did it go in?"" because I wouldn't even feel it."
Infamous-Asparagus21,"Good to know. I just want to do all the fun things I can. But if it’s a matter of safety and making sure nothing happens, I can live without going lol"
SaneFloridaNative,My seat belt rubbed on the port so I used a cushion between. I can't imagine a harness. I was afraid to swing a golf club so I wouldn't go on a ride but I am an overly cautious person. Just my 2 cents minus inflation.
Infamous-Asparagus21,I get that. I feel like if I got to the park I wouldn’t do it just in case I think my anxiety would take over. I was just curious if anybody had bc some people on a Disney forum said they have and some say they couldn’t etc
Littleshuswap,Thank you for your positive outlook. We all need a little reminder sometimes. Sending you love! 💖
dirkwoods,"Beautiful. I was given a 12-18 month median survival, which I took to heart. What was not embedded in those statistics is that we are in a golden era of cancer research. New lily pads keep popping up that can be utilized until ""durability"" becomes an issue. A perfect example is my brain mets with a median survival of 2-3 months- now extended to 2-3 years with a gamma knife procedure that didn't exist when I was a medical student. Another example is a silver bullet ADC chemo drug I am on that is shrinking my tumors- they have been talking about the ""silver bullet cancer drug"" that only attacks cancer cells for a century but now they are actually being used. Prepare for the worst and hope for the best. Figure out whether you want to do some lily pad hopping in hopes of outliving median survival (that only means half live longer and half shorter right?). We get to decide right?"
Necessary_Spray_5217,"When I had my worst cancer experience my oncologist refused even discussed the odds of survival. He told me that whatever those odds are, there are people who survived and people who don’t, so it’s up to you to survive, and the odds are irrelevant. We all worry about the odds, but really that’s the truth."
RelationshipQuiet609,You can do the best you can with a positive attitude but you can’t adjust for the underlying stress that is every day life. Those are the stresses that can put cancer into over drive. My house burned down at the time I was given a Stage 4 diagnosis! I lost everything-there is no greater stress than losing your home. (It is actually listed as one of the most stressful things you can go through). This was also cancer number 5. I don’t know what really the answer is-people are different. It’s really like the stages of grief-no one can tell you what you are going to feel or go through. There is nothing more complicated than cancer. I just take it one day at a time!
Big_Environment_4884,What a lovely positive and very true post. You are an inspiration to all of us. Thank you.
Necessary_Spray_5217,"It’s not the positive thought that is beneficial. It’s the lack of chronic stress and anxiety which weakens the immune system. When the immune system is too weak, it allows cancer to spread as opposed to killing off the cells. There is a great deal of evidence on this bread for many years. Also, it makes sense."
Necessary_Spray_5217,Back at you friend. It’s all true. It’s all good.
Seoul_Man-44,👊
LivingInThePresence,Love this! Thank you for sharing.
Ok-Blueberry-8142,I admire your positive attitude. Everyone is not like you. To hear that you have cancer is catastrophic. When you are 19 it’s hard to wrap your head around. Your first sentence of this post sounds condemning. It’s not that misery loves company. It’s takes everyone their own time to get used to their new existence. It’s been 2+ years for me and I still struggle.
Necessary_Spray_5217,"Good point. I was thinking that it is consoling to talk to other people about the same problem that you have, but it didn’t come across so well. The more I learn about cancer, the less afraid I am. I will always remember when I was given my diagnosis in the doctor’s office. It was totally devastating. Wanted to surgically remove body parts immediately and did not know about some of the more advanced treatments."
Zerohero2112,"This is the man of determination and belief. Belief is power, stress and negativity are killers of health. You don't need to believe in a religion, you can also believe in yourself in order to tap into that power and do actions. If you ever doubt the power of belief then go see the iconic burning monk pic again. He got engulfed in flame with no reactions at all, no pain, no panic, nothing, just calm and in deep mediation !"
Necessary_Spray_5217,"Psychoimmunology, or psychoneuroimmunology, studies the interactions between the mind, nervous system, and immune system, particularly how stress impacts immune function and cancer progression. Chronic stress is linked to immune dysregulation, which can exacerbate inflammation and impair the immune system’s ability to fight cancer effectively. Stress activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system, leading to hormonal changes that promote tumor growth and metastasis. Stress management strategies, including psychological and pharmacological interventions, are being explored to mitigate these effects and improve cancer outcomes.

Still_Falcon9705,My husband has the best positive can do attitude. We are at Moores Cancer center and the treatment team loves him. They really take such good care of him. Plus a good attitude is essential to your mental health. Get out there when you’re up to it and do the things you like to do.
Cuzmacoo2,"Cancer is certainly tolerable with the right mindset. If you’ve done all that you can do with the best medical treatment, let go of the stress, because that damages your immune response.Help yourself, don’t hurt yourself. Acceptance, education, and confidence. Don’t panic, tell yourself you’re overwhelmed, or that there is not a good solution. Don’t hurt yourself. Cancer is a challenge which requires education and mental peace to be tolerable. Dealing with cancer becomes an important activity. Cancer should not be the source of constant fear. That’s what cancer wants."
Faye-pas94,Amazing post thanks for it! 😃😃😃
gabsterspams,i had a 15% survival rate and i’m in full remission now. was diagnosed at 19 years old and was able to say i’m cancer free at 22. im 23 now and unfortunately lost my mom to cancer right after. it hit me like a truck. i wish more than ever that i died too from cancer. however i’m here and i know my mom would want me well and thriving. no matter how you look at it cancer is cancer and it’s an awful thing. i can only say the ONLY good thing that can come out of this disease is family. my moms death from cancer and my own battle has brought our family so damn close together. we hold onto everything. i appreciate every little damn thing now and will always hate cancer till i die.
TiggerT50,I’m a great believer in positive thoughts but on the head and neck forum the mod went berserk that I had mentioned it with threat that I have no research evidence Speak to any Oncologist and they will say the same So you know I am in remission from 3 cancers with my fingers crossed 😊
No_Cap_9561,There is actually no evidence to support this.
zombietalk15,Congratulations! I hope it stays like that for a very long time. Enjoy every day.

onehundredpetunias,"I'm stage IV NSCLC with mets to some nodes and one single brain met. I had gamma knife to the single brain met, chemo (carboplatin & alimta) and chest radiation. Unfortunately my body hates keytruda so that is no longer an option for me. I've just passed my 2 year post treatment anniversary. So far, I've had no new disease."
aquavitforvendetta,Love to hear this!! What kind of surveillance do they have you under at this point?
space_waterfall,"heyy! i'm 26f with lungs and recent brain metastasis and i removed the brain tumor this month, i'm currently 27 days after surgery and recovering well. i agree it is a weird place to be, but here we are and is good to know we're not alone!! count on me to chat :) wish you the best!"
aquavitforvendetta,"Look at you with your brain surgery -- you're hard-core. (: How are you feeling now? We've both got age on our side. I'm seriously considering screen-printing t-shirts that say ""YOUNG AND OTHERWISE HEALTHY."""
DiceQueen69,I had four brain Mets all fairly small. After radiation 3 are gone and the other one which was larger shrunk and Dr feels it will go away. Will be doing MRIs every 3 month to catch any reappearing early on. Still a long way to go but I'll take a small win.
aquavitforvendetta,"Three gone sounds like a big win! That's so great to hear. I'm on the every-three-months MRI schedule as well, and it's so much more reassuring than I would have imagined. I hope this isn't a game of whack-a-mole, but if it is, my doctors are ready to play."
NP_huh,"Hello there fellow 31/F with brain mets. I’m on the same boat, RCC mets in many places, 2 in my brain. I underwent proton therapy for the same, and immunotherapy (keytruda) every 3 weeks with Cabo everyday. There has been significant reduction. I have to get MRIs every 3 months. And I’m very hopeful for the next one. I know overall it sucks. My lifestyle has changed a lot. I do not feel like the same person I used to be pre diagnosis. But hope keeps me going. Stay strong out there!!"
aquavitforvendetta,"Why hello there! I'm guessing you ALSO had better plans for your early thirties. Cancer is a kick in the pants for sure. Significant reduction is great! I'll be thinking good thoughts for your next MRI. (: I have my second one since radiation coming up and I have fingers crossed for additional reduction. Life is certainly different now. I'm thirteen months from my original diagnosis and my feelings have evolved a lot; I'm working on starting to make plans again. Maybe I can have cancer and still do things. Maybe you can, too. (:"
DerkSC,All the best to you. Fight 👍🏻
aquavitforvendetta,Thank you. I don't know that I'm fighting as much as I'm just stubborn. 😂
dirkwoods,"HPV+ HNSCC with 7 brain mets treated with gamma knife May 2024 with good follow-up MRI. Advised repeat may be needed in 2-3 years (far exceeding my median survival estimate). I said, ""where do I sign up?"". Gamma knife was a breeze for me. Hopefully the gallows humor helps you too, it does me."
aquavitforvendetta,"Check us out, HPV+ Squamous Gang. 😏 It is SO great they were able to treat all the mets with gamma knife! I also found the procedure pretty breezy. Per one study, I've already exceeded the median survival and it's only been two months. I think that makes all humor gallows humor now, lol."
Feeling_Violinist934,"I had Folfox. Though some side effects did get worse, as the treatment progressed I developed a ""toolkit"" of ways to push back against the side effects. (Finding drinks I could could digest, electric hand warmers). ANd don't underestimate how the shock of the new, being blindsided by everything makes it all worse (first bite syndrome would still catch me off guard). Keep communicating with your team--the fact that they're listening open to making adjustments is not quite everything, but means a lot. Take care."
rollerG12,"Sorry you’re experiencing this…I just want to say, that side effects are not always cumulative and everybody is different. My first round of chemo was also the hardest, yet I just finished cycle 5 of 6 and this past cycle was the easiest so far. It was almost like my body had a tough time for the first round because the chemo was so foreign to my body, but it adjusted overtime. It might be tough all of the way through. Take it a day at a time. Dont worry about the 8+ more rounds, just get through today. Do that over and over again, and eventually you will be done. Anything worth doing is difficult."
47q8AmLjRGfn,"I had FLOT. It floored me, breathing problems, nearly passing out standing up or walking more than ten paces. Vomiting, constipation - frankly the worse I felt the happier I was, I thought if it was doing that to me, I must be doing something to the tumour."
inkrml,"My treatments got easier after the first few. I just had my tenth and it was one of the worst I have had in a while, but was still nowhere near as bad as the first few. You will feel so much better after your disconnect. It also usually only has me a day or two after disconnect before any nausea and stuff starts to go away until the next one. Everyone is different though."
ibakenaked,Folfirinox is also knocking me down. I’ve done folfiri and CAPOX prior to so I fucking get it. The only thing getting me through is first ct scan showed tumor shrinkage. Only 7 more to go.
seanixguy,"One foot in front of the other and a day at a time. I've been there twice, going thru another round of 12 treatments. Some advice. Consider a port. It makes the infusion process easier and saves damage to your veins. Stay ahead of the pain and nausea by taking your meds ahead of and during your treatments. I use Promethazine 12.5 mg for the nausea. Nothing else puts a dent in it. I know your favorite foods taste terrible, but you have to reduce your weight loss for you're going to lose 10's of pounds, otherwise you will have no energy at all, and these drugs are going to give you major fatigue. Eat everything that is high calorie, despite having absolutely no appetite, and most important drink large amounts of fluids the days after your infusion to get that poison out of your system. Good luck and God Bless you!"
mthoody,"FOLFIRINOX is reserved for otherwise healthy patients because it is a brutal cocktail of three cytotoxic chemos (5FU, Oxaliplatin, and irinotecan). If the side effects are too much, they can downshift to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI. My experience with the 5FU pump is as a minor inconvenience. I take Olanzapine every morning for nausea, it seems to work well for me. I’m not sure why you’re having trouble with your port, definitely discuss the tenderness with the nurse the next time they access your port. Some side effects are cumulative, others not so much. For example, the oxaliplatin cold sensitivity lessened for me, but the numbness was cumulative, to a point, then tapered off."
Yourmomkeepscalling,Just imagine what the cancer cells are dealing with. Hang in there and give’em hell!
MoeraBirds,"Talk to your oncologist ahead of the next one and tell them about your symptoms. I had FOLFIRINOX and my first infusion gave me the worst nausea - we changed my anti nausea regime for the second one and that helped a lot. The fatigue got worse, but the immediate symptoms got better with changes in all the other drugs. Hang in there, and talk to your team."
Decent-Patient-1379,"Chemo is a shitshow. My oncologist worked with me to keep it bareable. Even got a lower dose because i reacted so string. So, probably good to talk to your doctors. Good luck, and hang on!"
-Suriel-,"11 rounds of FOLFOX and 4 of 5fu here. I hate the hassle of toting that damn 5fu pump around. I’m 15 rounds deep with it and I don’t feel the needle anymore though. You get used to it and it becomes normal. Like others have said, not all the effects are cumulative. Mostly just the neuropathy in my experience. All the other symptoms you start to adjust to. The nausea is what got me, and the diarrhea. After every round I would go back to my oncologist and let her know what meds weren’t working. I went through quite a few before I landed on a good combo. Keep pushing till you find things that works for you. As for showering, I gave up on treatment weeks. I bought disposable wash clothes - they are just giant baby wipes - and use those. You can buy big packs at dollar tree. The nurses are used to it, I promise. I’ve had convos with mine about it. I’m sure this all feels daunting and awful but you can do it. You’re stronger than you know. Good luck to you Edited to remove paragraph about take down."
Yourmomkeepscalling,Normal. I had a bag I would take to my chemo infusions. 6 months later I can’t even look at that bag without getting nauseous.
ibakenaked,I still get nausea when I think of the cancer center. I also had to have my belly button removed which I know is minuscule to some breast cancer survivors but I feel like Frankenstein often.
Nodes420,Honestly you are not responding in an unusual way. You have quite literally walked through hell- seen all the horrors it entails - and made it out of the other side. Not necessarily in once piece. I am currently in remission but I’ve never really felt like a true husk of my former self until recently. Side effects mounted and I lost my ability to walk for a while. I think reclaiming as much as my health and hobbies as I possibly can in the next few years is the my light at the end end of the tunnel so to speak.
JellyFast,I relate. I can’t seem to get past it either. It’s been almost a year for me and it’s almost as if I went into survival mode during treatment. I didn’t process what was happening. Now I’m supposed to be moving on and I can’t. Treatment traumatized me. I am mourning the person I once was while almost dealing with ptsd from treatment. I wasn’t prepared for the after effects no one told me about. I have no answers but you are not alone.
CustomSawdust,"Caregiver here. I know my wife (and I) will suffer PTSD from this terrible experience. As someone who already has PTSD from childhood trauma, i do not look forward to this. There are therapists who specialize in cognitive therapy regarding cancer etc. This might help."
aligpnw,"Totally normal. When you're in the thick of it, there is no time to process, then it all hits you Luke a ton of bricks when you are ""done."" If you are able to, see a therapist or social worker (ask your oncology team if they can recommend someone, having a therapist with oncology experience is amazing.) If not, find a support group, there are so many folks who are or have been where you are. I promise, you are not alone and you are totally normal ❤️"
Dying4aCure,If you have estrogen positive breast cancer the estrogen blockers can make you quite depressed. Many of us needed anti depressants until our bodies got used to lack of estrogen. Also a good therapist may help if you are not on estrogen blockers. It will probably help if you are! This is all normal. Your body has been through a lot.
Just_Dont88,"The trauma is there. I’ve been going through chemo for a month now for my cancer and trauma is already there. Bring told I had cancer started it. Every chemo, medication reaction, the seizure I got some odd reason had during an MRI, the side effects from chemo, being stuck in the hospital for weeks, just being away from your normal, the many and any lumbar punctures I have to have. The mental, emotional, and physical trauma is there for me and it’s only been a month in. I know there will be more to come. I hate that your family seems to have left you in the process, and that’s its own trauma. Try to find a support group that you can talk to that have gone through your same battle. I hope that you get better and can move past this♥️"
Decent-Patient-1379,"I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. However, i think it is normal. It ie traumatic, what you have been through. I've had cancer twice in the last 6 six years, and dealing with the trauma is hard. Especially because not everyone understands it, since ""you're better now"". What i do is try to process the trauma, and i look for support."
Sensitive-Degree-980,"I often get the same feelings after under going a Whipple surgery. My PCP has diagnosed me with PTSD. The trauma of that surgery and the recovery are forever etched in my mind. There is not a day that goes by that I don’t think about it. Just remember to love yourself, give yourself time and be proud of yourself as a survivor ❤️"
julieannie,"I went straight from treatment to my final year of college, graduated, started my first career job, got engaged, got married, all within 18 months. And then I crashed and burned spectacularly. I hate how normal it is and I spent a lot of time in therapy, on medications, unemployed, underemployed, barely coping. Now I still have some bad days but also I have a lot of days where I never think about cancer, something I didn't ever think was possible in those really dark times. It took longer to heal because I was in such denial for so long. Cancer treatment was hard but I wasn't prepared for how hard being a cancer survivor was. It's normal but it's also not something you have to endure without support."
Last_Course_8431,I still dream that I’m lying in that hospital bed slowing losing my breath as I die. I didn’t die then but I almost did and it really stuck with me.
This-Army6223,"Yes I did it. Dealing with stage 4 Endometrial cancer , a rare aggressive kind. I did many lines of treatment since May of 2023 and none of them got rid of it. It started spreading again despite other medications etc. In June , the oncologist told me that he wanted to start taxol again . That was my option. I told him nope. It was horrendous before and I was not doing it again if it wasn't even going to cure it. Once you quit treatment , your doctor recommends you for hospice. I believe you need a prognosis of six months or less for hospice. I love my hospice nurse. She comes once a week right now , unless I can convince her to do a telehealth visit. She makes medication suggestions and everything is at the doorstep next day.Right now I'm still active and busy. I'm dealing with overall body aches and pains like when you have the flu, and liver pain. But I take pain meds that are available to me and I do normal as much as possible. I go out often, drive places , cook, etc. Once you are on hospice, they will stop treatment for everything. So just be aware of that. For instance, they suspected that I had a blood clot in my leg. I was told since I'm in hospice it was not going to be treated, however if I wanted it to be treated I could take myself off of hospice, have whatever procedure done, and then sign myself right on again the next day. So it's not like once you're on hospice you're stuck there. You can take yourself off if you decide to have a treatment etc. I hope this helps. For me, it was an easy choice because chemo was such hell, and I wasn't about to do that again if it wasn't going to result in at least a remission etc."
onehundredpetunias,"Good on you for advocating for yourself and knowing your mind. Also- with respect, people on Hospice can be treated without disenrolling. As long as the condition is not related to the hospice diagnosis, it's allowed. https://hospicefoundation.org/Hospice-Care/Dispelling-Hospice-Myths"
Mission-Squirrel4721,"Just want to commend you for advocating for yourself. And being active and living your life! I was just talking about hospice care with family. I did not realize you could get off of hospice to get treatment, and then be put back on? We thought once you choose hospice, you’re stuck there. Thank you for this info. And wishing you all the best!"
This-Army6223,"Also , I would strongly suggest an antidepressant. The kind of crap we've dealt with would leave anyone with a scrambled brain. I was crying constantly. I told my oncologist flat out I was not okay. She recommended me to the hospital's cancer psychiatrist who put me on a low dose of antidepressant. It's honestly been extremely game changing for me. The hospice nurse can also can give medications for anxiety etc. I'm so sorry you're dealing with all this crap."
ant_clip,"To echo and amplify what others have suggested, because you are so depressed, why not first talk to a therapist just to talk it all out before making a decision to stop. I also agree that talking to someone from hospice might be helpful so you have a sense of what that will be like. I decided to forgo treatment. I am stage 3/4 metastatic adenocarcinoma unknown primary (CUP). I was 67, diagnosed when it metastasized to my liver. After liver resection surgery, I was told 6 months to a year no treatment and maybe 3 or 4 with treatment. I elected no treatment. In addition to being older I also have stage 4 emphysema. Context is everything. My oncologist was very supportive with my decision. It is my life, my body, it was my decision. My friends and family understand, it took a few conversations with some but they get it and respect my decision. My oncologists were really wrong with their prognosis, I am an outlier and incredibly fortunate. Still here 4 years later, a couple of small mets in lymph nodes that are very slowly growing for now. I am so very sorry you are going through this and facing this decision. If you have any questions feel free to ask or even DM me."
This-Army6223,"Wow, you are a rock star! That's amazing!"
Dying4aCure,"Hugs. State 4 Breast Cancer here since 2016. I was given three years. These drugs make us depressed. The advice to try an antidepressant is a good one. It is your choice, but doing chemo when the pain got terrible was way better than going through the pain. All of it is palliative, anyway. Be comfortable. Do whatever suits you, but be sure what you are looking at. I don't think I will do more chemo, but if I choose not to, I won’t be telling my family it is an option. Visit us at r/LivingWithMBC we get it. ❤️"
FragrantEcho5295,"I am deeply sorry that you are going through this. Outside of the sage suggestion already posted in this thread, I would suggest that you not put more weight on what others want you to do and instead focus on gathering as much information as possible to make an informed decision for yourself. Hospice is many services all wrapped in to one source. Call hospice and arrange a consultation. They can answer any questions that you have. As you read the responses in this post, try to remember that hospice and other options look different in actuality for each person. I wish you care, compassion, empathy and peace."
onehundredpetunias,"Cancer patient and former Hospice nurse here. Most, if not all Hospices will provide an informational visit. This involves explaining what Hospice is and is not, what's available and how insurance coverage works. Could you call your primary or oncologist and request a referral? Whether it's from family, the internet (including this sub) or even your physician, there is so much misinformation and misunderstanding of Hospice. Please speak to a Hospice professional before deciding that you understand it and making a decision."
This-Army6223,"Also understand that you can pick and choose what to do with hospice. I find my hospice nurse to be amazingly chill and flexible. I decided to stop the social worker services. I wasn't crazy about her constant talk about needing to know all my funeral arrangements etc. and how do I feel about becoming incapacitated etc ( I think it's great, how would you feel??) I am still living here and now and very active and want to focus on that for now. So no more social worker. No chaplain because I have a wonderful pastor and his wife who look after me by calling every couple of days to pray with me and talk etc. My adult kids who live at home are in counseling and my husband starts counseling this week. So adding a social worker to the mix is just more time away from doing all i want to do and they are a-okay with all that.I find hospice to be very flexible and reassuring. I sought their help long before I really needed it and it absolutely put my mind at ease. It took me a week to build up the courage to call once the doctor put in the recommendation, but im glad I did."
GameofCheese,"I'm gonna paste something I wrote in a different post. I think it fits here too... Taking control of your quality of life by choosing to end treatments is brave and can make a horrible end a nicer one with less pain, more family, and maybe some last adventures. Choosing to end treatment is just as valid as doing clinical trials and everything else one can do to try to remove the cancer. No one else can tell any of us what we should or shouldn't do. In my case, it was pure luck we caught it earlyish and it was ""very treatable"" with current medicine. But it was also mere chance that I had shoulder/ neck pain that helped find my last tumor behind my facial sinuses. I don't know, if I had gone longer and it hadn't been discovered for many more years, I might have chosen not to ""fight"" and simply enjoy the time I had. We're all different, every case is different, every family is different. No choices are fit for everyone. There is nothing wrong with picking and choosing what actions you want to take on this journey. It's your journey, no one else's. There is a lot of beauty in choosing your final days. Most people never get to do that. As a culture we are terribly naive about medicine and death. I worked in a children's hospital and honestly some of the best gifts a parent can give a child is a gentle passing. There is nothing wrong with that. Medicine can only do so much. Being an adult and giving yourself that gift should be a positive thing not an offensive one to others."
featherblackjack,"I don't, though I have thought about it. I'm stage 4 inflammatory as well, but my cancer has always responded well. It's the side effects that are killing me. I've had it in my liver, my chest and thyroid, most importantly in my brain. That's the real reason I'm still taking treatment. I don't wanna die of brain cancer. That's a bad way to go. Have you taken Enhertu? It's keeping me stable, for almost a year at this point."
rollerG12,"Well said. I struggled with the notion of “fighting” at first. I thought about the people who are so sick at the time of their diagnosis that they don’t even get the chance to “fight” and we would never say that they didn’t “fight” or “gave up” or whatever, so I keep thinking to myself how on earth can we call it a fight when it seems like luck/random for those who even get an opportunity to see treatment and have a chance to survive…I almost felt like calling it “fighting” was a slap in the face to those who don’t have a chance to “fight”… Then I came to my own conclusion that fighting is just continuing on with cancer. Whether it’s showing up to work every day, or laying in a hospital bed. Whether you feel great or you’re encumbered by intense pain. The second that you realize that you have cancer, your fight begins whether you know it or not, and no matter what you decide your plan of action/treatment (or lack there of) will be. Much love. Stay strong out there 💪."
terryterryd,Not here for the long time: might as well be the good time. God bless.
WhodatSooner,😂✌️❤️🫵
Alienspacedolphin,"A few years back one of my bestest buddies had not just one but TWO metastatic cancers. (Renal cell and mantel cell lymphoma) He never did like to do anything halfway. They said he wouldn’t make it a year so threw himself a memorial service. Bought a shiny red convertible on credit. Decided to do chemo and did better than anyone thought he would. Threw a ‘second memorial service’. Wrote his own obituary and insisted that his ashes be sprinkled on the lawn of his worst enemy so he could haunt him forever. He drove the hell out of that car. Smoked on oxygen and survived. Took me dancing. He taught me more about painting and composition while criticizing art at MD Anderson than I’ve learned anywhere else. (Ive had to do some time myself at MD Anderson as of late, their care is better than the art) I miss you my friend. You knew how to live."
[deleted],I have been WAGING a battle against cancer for 9 years!
Constantlearner01,Well said. I am going to try that “travel if you feel good” since we had to cancel 3 trips with my diagnosis last December. I wonder if my fear of flying has gone away. Will test it out.
justmycanceraccount,"I struggled with the concept of my “fighting cancer,” mostly because I’m not actively doing anything to engage in the combat. The doctors and nurses are doing battle on my behalf - me, an observer- my body, the battlefield. And to perhaps align my metaphor with your perspective, perhaps the best I can do is tend the garden - keep the battlefield watered, manicured, and full of sunlight & flowers."
WhodatSooner,"Yeah. You got it. Even if / when they stop treating you for whatever reason, it’s the fight to keep trying to live and love as much as you possibly can - no matter what it takes- for one day. And if you wake up, try to do it again but be ok with yourself if you can’t."
Yourmomkeepscalling,"This. First of all congrats on making it through! I completely freaked at my stage 4 diagnosis, but it turns out cancer can be beaten back. Even older treatments have evolved to work with new immunotherapies to great effect for many. Anyone and everyone, don’t lose hope and don’t give up. While I may not ultimately win, I’m not going out without a fight. Stay strong people!"
OnlyTheGoodDieYun,Op this is very inspiring!!!!! My outlook was 1 year if no treatment and 5% to make it 5 years. 6 months into treatments I’ve had an amazing response and now they are talking I could be clear as well!!! For everyone out there fighting keep fighting hard! Don’t accept a bleak outlook. Fight hard keep your head up … I love all of you even though we haven’t met! I pray for the best outcome for everyone!!
iamscaredofyou33,"I’m in the car, with my daughter, and I see a notification pop up on my phone saying “just had 5 year scan and all clear” … from a complete stranger! I’m beyond happy for you friend, and I hope u never have a scan that shows cancer again! May all ur hopes and dreams come true!!! Congratulations 🎉🍾"

Snowhitemy4b,What amazing news and it gives me much hope!! I have Carcinoma of the Endometrium stage 3B. Just went through Chemo and start Radiation this Thursday!!
driftingthroughtime,"Definitely get yourself a new oncologist, and insist on a full torso CT scan. Also … I get it. Treatment sucks ass. (I call it torture.) Remember that cancer is part of you and that they need to kill your healthy parts in order to get the cancer. So, there’s a push/pull situation going on treat/recover, rinse and repeat until the cancer is gone or you are. I can personally attest that the treatment works, and you can make it to the other side. But, I have found that your body never really fully recovers. Of course, it’s better than the alternative. (I was stage 4 rectal, but after numerous surgeries, two courses of chemo, and radiation to my brown star, I have been cancer free for 8 years.)"
MindlessParsley1446,May I ask why you don't have an oncologist? I'm really sorry to hear of your struggles. I've had many myself. I found that utilizing my anger energy towards doing some of the crappy stuff like dealing with thousands of dollars in insurance claims helped me through it - I felt like it was something within my control at least..
phalaenopsis_rose,"I'm sorry. I'm a year into living with stage IV cancer and working full time. I'm exhausted and live for the good moments. Find another team, atleast a palliative care doctor. They can help with the burns and getting medicines to help you feel, okay. I can't promise you'll feel great. I'm definitely not who I was and can't enjoy the things I used to. So I had to find other things to focus on to get me through the day. And if I can't, I vent and throw a fit. Then I pick myself back up and do something differently."
JellyFast,"Yes, that’s another thing, I never stopped working. I worked very full time through treatment. I only missed two days when chemo kicked my ass I couldn’t find the strength. I was remote for most of my treatment them back in office once I finished. I never rested, I never got a chance to absorb the fact I have cancer. I feel like it’s hitting me now that I’m not in panic mode. I’m working on a new oncology team. My insurance is terrible. Thank you for the reply! I’m just being a baby"
Terrible-Big-Baby888,"Hey—I can relate to a lot of what you’re saying regarding feeling like you’ll be yourself again OR even the having to begin the “journey” over. We’re tired. We’re defeated. We’re isolated and alone. We’re beat up but most of all.. we’re scared. I learned the hard way that if you are able to.. and up to it.. and not too sick.. you HAVE to be your own advocate.. fight for what you know you need. Demand it. Also.. fuck the medical bills (but I understand that feeling of rage/anger/underlying stress of being unable to pay/refusing to pay).. but.. shred them. Trash them. Remember the quality of your life has no price tag on it. And those bills will NOT matter when we’re at the final stages of this “journey.” I too kicked ASS at treatment last year to only end up sicker and in a way more severe state this year. It’s not fair at all & we have no choice if we want to live a bit longer. Anyways, I don’t think we will ever feel like ourselves again. So much of our “selves” has been taken from us without any of our say… so I am trying to work hard at grieving my previous self and I recommend you trying to do the same. And in my grieving (which we’re grieving so much more than that)… I’m gaining acceptance of my situation (as best I can). It’s heartbreaking and only YOU understand the devastation. Despite your situation resonating with me—still, only YOU understand YOUR devastation. But we can never go back to before our diagnosis or our battle to beat cancer. We can only keep moving forward. I don’t mean to use toxic positivity because fuck that, I’m bout to spazz on the next person that uses that on me.. but if we can have moments of hope, and moments of acceptance and moments of still loving ourselves.. then we will take it. Because yes, we are tired. We are beat up. We’re scared. We lack trust in the medical field. And we feel alone.. I’m here. New to Reddit but figuring it out & seeing there are communities here that truly support (and real dumbasses that are entertainingly stupid). You may message me anytime. We can chat isolation and devastation. You’re not alone, just like I’m not alone."
ibakenaked,I have stage 4 colon cancer. Look into the colon town group - they’re a godsend for all things related to colon cancer. Find a new oncologist because you should still be getting regular scans done. Idk where you are but the ColonTown group can legit reccomend oncologists or hospitals to reach out to.
Aware-Marketing9946,Get estradiol cream. It will heal your insides and atm it's considered safe as it doesn't travel past the blood barrier. You need debt consolidation. Is there anyone you know with any banking or fiduciary experience? I've handled a few for family. I was misled as well. I was angry. But we can't stay that way. Take one day at a time. Deep breath. I will pray for you🙏🫂
JellyFast,Thank you!
trixiemushroompixie,"I know you are in between teams and it seems money might be tight but you 1 million percent should look into therapy. It was quite literally the most important part of my recovery. I definitely had these sentiments I thought why on earth did I fight so hard just to go back to this grind, work pay bills, where are the epic bucket list moments. Instead of celebrating my body’s ability to heal I felt betrayed. I felt like a ghost in the in between. Therapy helped me gain perspective and resolve my anger around my missed diagnosis. Maybe your area offers free cancer support networks. I am sorry you feel this way. ❤️"
YesYeahWhatever,"I don't think we ever feel normal again, rather we adjust to a new normal. As an aside, if the cancer spread only to your lymph nodes and nowhere else, that makes you stage 3B or 3C depending on the number of nodes involved. Stage 4 means a spread to other organs. I wish you the best going forward."
LuckyTHR,Stay strong!
iSheree,"First of all, I am sorry that you're dealing with this. Second of all, you do not need to or want to go to a psych ward unless you're a danger to yourself and/or others. And thirdly, it is normal, whatever you are feeling. Just try and let it come and go in waves. Just breathe. Hugs. Since the cancer is contained to the uterus, you probably will only need the hysterectomy right? 20% or 1 in 5 women have had a hysterectomy by your age. I think you will be just fine. Just have to take care of yourself and your mental health. On a serious note though, I had cancer surgery last year on my neck and chest and I am having a hysterectomy soon at 33 years old (for gyno issues) and I can't imagine living alone going through these surgeries. Is there anyone that can help you after your surgery? Can you go stay with someone just while you recover?"
Mama_Ohana,"I have my daughter flying in from across the country to come to the surgery with me. She will stay till 4 September and my son is coming on 1 September to stay as long as I need him to. After that if I am still not well, I may live with my sister for a while. So I’m good that way. I stopped crying and picked up some crocheting. It’s helping me calm down."
TampaBob57,"It's a battle, physically, mentally, emotionally and for me spiritually, there's no handbook on how we're supposed to react and when feeling overwhelmed. If asocial worker or chaplain visits you just let them know about how you are feeling."
Aware-Marketing9946,I'm 63. Cry if you need to. Please hang in there. It's going to be ok. I had a total hysterectomy in 2018 (cancer #3) and that was the easiest surgery out of the 9 I've had so far. I'll be praying for you 🙏
needysaurus_rex,"I’m sorry to hear about what you’re dealing with but you’ve got this!! It’s totally normal to feel like this, it’s been 4 years since I was diagnosed but I still cry about it."
beeboobum,I’m sorry! I have stage 4 ovarian and had a hysterectomy. It goes by so fast once you check into the hospital. You’re in good hands. You’re going to be just fine. ❤️
DerkSC,Sorry to hear about your condition. It’s ok to let out your emotions. I sincerely hope you have friends and family to comfort you. I’ll say a prayer for you.
HonestPerception9094,You will be fine honestly I had full hysterectomy ten years ago and it was a blessing it’s natural to be scared but your asleep and it’s over with in about hour or hour and half good luck x
This-Army6223,"No it's normal. I am battling endometrial cancer at 55. I have permanent sags under my eyes from crying this past year. Let me tell you, you need to get help. I finally bottomed out and said I need help. They set me up at the hospital psychiatrist who put me on an antidepressant. It helped immediately. I'm also on Ativan as needed. They honestly do not understand the psychological and emotional impact of cancer. I'm hoping that once you get the surgery you start to feel better. A lot of this is dread and fear. All of your emotions are normal and you're not going crazy. Cancer is a rape and a thief ; it steals from you, it violates your body it invades your life and your plans. Everything that you're going through is normal however that doesn't mean that you have to endure it. There are medications that can help you. I've never been on an antidepressant in my life and never thought I needed it. However within a week of starting to take the anti depressant I began to be able to think clearer. Horrible anxiety went away. Hang in there and check back in because there were many people here who know exactly how you feel."
GravityPools,"I'm so sorry you're having such a difficult time. It is scary, and you shouldn't have to go through this alone. The hospital should be able to connect you to a cancer support group or other type of support, please tell someone at the hospital and ask if they have any suggestions for help. You're not the only one who's been terrified when dealing with a cancer diagnosis. That said, I had cancer 15 years ago, mastectomy, hysterectomy, oophorectomy...and I'm still showing no evidence of a recurrence. There is hope and a life after cancer. Hugs and love and strength. Also, here are links to two orgs in the US that can help you find support in your area. Cancer Support Community American Cancer Society"
Aware-Marketing9946,"I know it's kinda late but here are some things that help after that surgery: Heating pad. My back hurts so bad after. And it wrapped around my sides too. I love the auto shutoff on mine. Body pillow and or small squishy pillows Assortment of teas. Calming teas. Super helpful. Small ice packs. Have your essentials next to the bed. Get a bed tray...or see if someone can pick it up for you. Baby wipes Something to do while reclining...I love gel pens and adult coloring books or drawing paper. I'll be thinking of you. I am sorry you live alone. Do you have a trusted neighbor? You could call your local social services and request rides, or help. I volunteered for an org called fish. We bought food, picked up meds .. whatever the person needs. Reach out to your care team and ask about any after care. I had a visiting nurse for 6 weeks, once a week. She was a lifesaver. After my dmx I could barely look at my scars/chest. She did so much for me. Please look into it. Insurance covered it. I'm a DM away if I can help, lmk. Btw, not that you asked...but everything still, um, works ""down there"" if you know what I mean. I'm with you in spirit, and I will absolutely pray for you🙏🤗👊"
Tymprr,"Hi Op, I don't know you but I'm sending you all my best wishes and pray you'll have a successful surgery and smooth recovery"
BetterNowThks,"You will be ok! I'm 59, hysterectomy in April but the cancer had already burst a fallopian tube and that ovary and spread in the cavity so they took my peritoneum as well. I am on chemo every 4 weeks but in between I am able to do most everything. If you don't have spread, thank your lucky stars! The surgery is a big one but get up as soon as possible and start moving, i promise it helps! You can do this. 💕"
Mad-Hettie,"Your reaction is 100% okay and normal. I think, culturally, cancer occupies the same mental space as the Boogeyman for a lot of us. It's a literal worst case scenario for a lot of us, like hearing a knock at the door and realizing it's Freddy Krueger. It's okay to be scared and to react with fear towards something you want nothing to do with. You're not crazy, you're ok, and I wish you all the luck with your surgery."
Clear_Avocado_8824,If you lived by me I would certainly be there for you personally!! I am holding your hand through the miles❤️‍🩹❤️🩷
Defiant-Aerie-6862,"I’m sorry you are going though this, it is scary! I had uterine cancer in 2020, had a hysterectomy and have been fine since. I had a pretty easy recovery from surgery, it was done when I was 50, but I wish I’d had it done sooner! Wishing you a good recovery and good health"
Red_3101,"100% normal! I recently had surgery for ovarian cancer, unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, left side for a Grade 3 Stage 1A immature teratoma. I cried like a baby for a month! Tried being brave for everyone around me, but deep down was scared AF! I had to wait a month since discovering that I had it for the surgery as i previously had a bone marrow transplant earlier this year and some complications of GVHD that needed to be attended to before surgery. They were worried no doubt, but if there is one time, it is now, to believe that God or the universe has your back and it’s all going to be okay. Sending lots of love and positive energy your way, may you be blessed and healthy and it’s all going to be okay. You got this! ❤️"
Livinginadream_Co,It’s normal you feel this way. I’m sorry you’re going through this situation. cancer sucks and you are right feeling scared and sad and hopeless. I’m glad your children will be helping you. Stay positive if you can that will help your inmune system. You could take therapy after the surgery. Get in support groups so you don’t feel alone. Keep strong. You got this ans Fuck cancer!
sadsnoopymusic,"Sending you love and calming energy. Take it moment by moment. You are strong. I was terrified like you. The hysterectomy is a big surgery but one that the surgeons will have a lot of experience with. All you need to do afterwards is rest. Listen to your body. I’m nearly a year out from mine and I feel so much stronger. No more anaemia! If you need to talk to a lovely group of women who get it, I recommend r/endometrialcancer"
AdventurousSleep5461,"It's perfectly normal to cry and be upset about this; it's scary! My hospital has a special counseling department for cancer patients, you might consider asking your doctor for a referral to at least talk to someone about your feelings in a therapy setting."
KittyKatHippogriff,I am so sorry. I got a hysterectomy last year. The recovery will be slow. Please be easy on yourself.
CherGus,I'm 68 and having a hysterectomy this Friday for endometrial cancer FIGO 1and I'm very nervous too. I'm glad you will have support and hopefully a quick recovery. I hear many stories from women saying their recovery was pretty darn easy. Good luck and I'll say a prayer for you. Oh and also my ultrasound result took two months to give me my results
Aware-Marketing9946,🫂 prayers sent 🙏 My surgery is in a few weeks
DownWriteCancerous,"Ask your hospital's social worker about options/support groups. There is also the option for nursing-assisted rehab. Basically staying in a hospital hotel while you recover. Its absolutely okay to want an adult or parental figure in these moments. Cancer is terrifying, surgery is scary and painful. Glad to see your kids are going to coming to visit. Community is so important with things like this. Church, friends, support groups, even sewing/hobby groups. For packing, if you're staying in the hospital: pillow (neck pillow or memory foam, soft throw blanket, tooth brush, soft super stretchy sports bra if you wear bras, big loose tshirt or dress, soft socks with grips (the grip is important, the nurses wont let you wear them usually without grip), a little battery or usb fan if you need a fan to sleep, and a comfort item or two. Maybe it's a picture frame of loved ones, or a stuffed animal (I have a weighted dragon that I've taken to every hospital stay). You got this. :)"
pinkpeony90,"I’m so sorry, I was 31 when I had my hysterectomy. I had endometrial cancer. I didn’t have kids, and I’m unable to carry obviously. It robbed me of my happiness. I don’t feel women enough most days. I will pray for you."
OnlyTheGoodDieYun,Good luck w the surgery. Anxiety before something like this is normal. Prayers your surgery is a success and goes smoothly.
ayeshakskrododkd,"cancer is an emotional mental and physical fight, so that reaction is normal, youre not crazy. needing your mom means you need people around u pls please dont isolate yourself no matter how tempting and be around loved ones who can support you through it"
Alienspacedolphin,"I had a total hysterectomy last November for endometrial cancer, and yeah, it’s normal. I was lucky and didn’t need anything else. I was basically physically completely recovered in 3 months, even placed in a 5k. Be kind to yourself. Even though the surgery and recovery are relatively easy from a physical standpoint, it’s a lot to take in, and took me longer to readjust mentally/emotionally. Best of luck to you, and I hope all goes well."
ImpossibleHouse6765,You will be fine. I had a hysterectomy for cervical cancer in 2022 I live on my own did it all by myself. You are strong You got this.
LalahLovato,"It is a shock when you are first told “cancer” I am in BC and I can say the care I got was the best. Not sure where you are in Canada but rest assured that many people that travel from a rural area to a big centre where the Cancer Clinics get just as good care. If you need further support, let the nurse have the hospital social worker come and talk with you - and also call (or chat or text) 211 and talk with someone if you require any financial or transportation or any other help. This is the best resource for finding support in your community as they list all government, volunteer, non profit and other agency assistance in any area. Hopefully you have someone to accompany you and give emotional support. The surgery itself (I had the same diagnosis as you) I found not to be too bad, I hardly had any discomfort and was up and around almost right away. Take one day at a time. Good luck to you."
phalaenopsis_rose,"Let the tears flow as you pack, travel and prepare for this surgery. Allow yourself to grieve. Your entire life has changed with one word. Be kind to yourself; we are all here and we will be waiting for you when you return."
Similar_Track_4488,Try not to fret. Be grateful that you can have it removed in one surgery. I found an awesome zoom site called cancer.org.
PetalumaDr,"Not sure if discussing what your fears are with those who love you and know you best would help or not. I doubt it would hurt. I'm not sure if the fear is surgical complication, death, losing a part of who you are with a gender specific body part, loss of control when out,... All are valid fears and some can be addressed by your care team and some by friends and family. It often turns out that cognitive work around say a risk of dying from surgery being 1/10,000 can help with that specific fear (that is less than the risk of dying by driving to the hospital). Good luck."
Puzzleheaded_Key5211,Very normal go be scared. Lean on your nurse and care team. Reach out to people in your life who work in Healthcare and can help!!
ThrowTFAwayyyyyyy,"My mom had her surgery in June. She’s turning 69 this year. I’m pretty sure she was feeling the exact same way but please just talk to someone about it. I don’t live w her but I do see here often to take care of her. I pray that you’ll be okay. Even though it’s hard, also try expressing your emotions to your children. My mom did that to me and even though it felt heavy, I was able to give advice that somewhat helped. I still do lol. Your kids are there for you."
USBlues2020,"Oh... Sweet ♥️ Baby Doll Of course it's normal to be upset about this and crying Do you have family or friends, children anyone who can travel with you or meet you at the hospital, who is taking care of you after you are done in the hospital ? Peace be with you ♥️🙏☦️🙏☦️♥️"
GloomyDealer912,"I’m so sorry to hear you’re dealing with this. Please keep doing the things that you love that keep your mind occupied. It’s okay and human to be scared, there’s nothing wrong with feeling like that. Nobody talks about the grief one feels when facing such a scary thing as cancer, something you didn’t choose or expect but I’m glad to hear your children are there for you and by your side. Wishing you a safe trip for your surgery and that your recovery goes smoothly. Sending you a lot of courage, support and positive vibes!"
Stunning_Flower_8898,"It's okay OP, nobody is as strong as life expects us to be I'm sorry you're going through this. If it helps, the human mind can adapt to some seriously heinous shit, evolutionarily our species has gone through a lota crap. Hope you feel better soon."
Mama_Ohana,Thank you so much for those encouraging words! 🌼
Beautiful_Limit7801,"I’m so sorry you’re experiencing this, and I’m here to say I know exactly how you feel. Back in April I went in for surgery (oesophagectomy) and I was petrified - mostly because my brain was in panic mode and convincing itself we might not make it out alive. I spent the day before my surgery with my partner, his older brother, my soon-to-be SIL, their baby girl and his younger brother. We had what should’ve been a lovely day out shopping and grabbing lunch. I didn’t eat anything because I was so riddled with anxiety I would’ve been sick on the spot. We took the kids to the arcade and at that point, I don’t know what came over me but I walked away from the group, had a full blown panic attack and cried in my partner’s arms. I felt so guilty and as if I should just get a grip, but he insisted it was fine that I wanted to go back to my car. When we sat back in there, I cried my eyes out again. I kept having episodes like this for the rest of the day. I voiced how terrified I was that this meant I wouldn’t see him again and that we wouldn’t get the life together that I wanted. He did his best to comfort me but he admitted he was scared too. Leaving his house to drive home and pack that night was one of the hardest goodbyes of my life. Now? I’m 4 months post op and pretty much fully functional 90% of the time. The surgery wasn’t without complications unfortunately (but half expected from a major op which took 10 hours to do) and it kept me in hospital for over 3 weeks - but even so, I was up and about the day I came home from the hospital, driving within about 5 weeks and I’m already starting to feel like it didn’t even happen. I’ve since moved in with my partner (and the goodbyes are now a “drive safe, see you when you get home”) and I’m even now back to work. My point is: you’re completely valid to feel how you feel. You’re not unhinged, you’re allowed to be scared and/or upset. Give yourself grace, you’re experiencing major upheaval- it IS a big deal. BUT: you will be okay. Trust the experts to do what they need to do, I’m sure you will be in safe hands. And the fact that you’re eligible for surgery is usually a good sign. Good luck to you, look after yourself and you’ll be on the other side of the surgery soon enough ❤️"
Dizzy-Ad-9015,I just wanted you to know that my wife and I will keep you in our prayers and thoughts. My wife is 42 and is battling her 3rd cancer and had her sigmoid removed and now has a colostomy bag. Just know that you have a lot of love and prayers coming your way. Just be sure to let us all know when you're strong enough to let us know you are OK and healing! God bless
ProfessionalBeach372,I understand the fear as I had a lung removed from cancer last year. I don’t get the crying about it. There’s nothing you can do. There never was! Put on your big girl panties and get the show in the road. I wish you good luck and God’s will. ❤️
trixiemushroompixie,"Pain in my rib back, tried physio, acupuncture, yoga nothing helped eventually got so bad I would yelp whenever I moved. Doc ordered CT was read negative for everything no osseous lesion detected. I thought impossible and working in physical rehab I got my images not just report. Found a black hole pathological fracture of 8 th rib in 156 of 1300 images. Knew instantly I was looking at a lytic lesion. With much difficulty and mention of involving CPSO I got bone scan. Confirmed malignant. Biopsy later. Langerhans cell sarcoma. Thoracotomy to remove 8th rib and chunk of chest wall. Currently NED."
smartypants333,"February of 2021 my appendix burst. While they were scanning for that they said ""Huh, we see a little something here in your lung. It's probably nothing, but you should probably get it checked out when you get out of the hospital."" Got it checked out, it was stage 1 lung cancer. While they were doing the scans for that so they could remove the lower right lobe of my lung (April) they found a brain tumor. ""It's not cancer, but it still needs to come out."" So after I recovered from my lung surgery, I had brain surgery in June. They said that I was cancer free at that point, but it came back stage 4 (in my bones) 18 months later (Sept 2022)."
Defiant-Aerie-6862,"Pain in upper abdomen for a few months, I have diverticulosis, I thought maybe it was related to that. After 2nd trip to GI he ordered an ultrasound and found a 3.5 cm mass which they said was at the head of my pancreas. After a CT, and MRI and an endoscopic ultrasound with biopsy, I have a neurowndocrine turn or between my liver and pancreas, just got the PET scan last week, have an appointment this week with a surgical oncologist, hoping for operable 👍"
CloverChill,Blood from intercourse no matter how gentle we tried to be. The amount of blood would vary but 9 times of 10 there was at least some.
slythwolf,"I had back pain for about 6 months, but I thought it was a) muscular and b) due to my shitty mattress. Then I woke up one morning and couldn't feel my legs, so I called 911."
Yourmomkeepscalling,What I thought was a stomach ulcer turned out to be stage 4 gastric cancer.
Adventurous-Laugh270,Weight loss…. Oily poops…. Weird feeling like i was full but hadn’t eaten. Don’t really know how to describe stomach pain…. Thinkin gallbladder … get scan. 7x8 cm tumor on pancreas w Mets to liver .
MindlessParsley1446,I had no symptoms whatsoever. Stage IV lung cancer (ROS1+ Non-Small Cell)
DeadMansPizzaParty,"Raspberry ripple poops that seemed like they probably were something to be concerned about. One colonoscopy later, here I am doing chemo for stage 2 rectal cancer."
beeboobum,Tiny swollen lymphnode under my ear = stage 4 ovarian cancer
pfflynn,"Acute pancreatitis episodes. First put me in the hospital for 10 days. Gall stones blocked the pancreas. Removed my gall bladder. But every month, more or less, I’d end up back in the ER with pancreatitis. Took my GI doc and team 8 months to finally find the tumor (they used the only Spyglass + ERCP device in the Metroplex to find it. By the time it was removed a 5 weeks later it had spread and grown. If they hadn’t kept looking I would be dead now."
selfmadeoutlier,"They misinterpreted weight loss, visual migraines, and brain fog for seasonal depression. A severe food poisoning led finally to an initial diagnosis due to the scrambled blood checks."
DragonFlyMeToTheMoon,No symptoms. Glad I kept up w/my annual lady appointments! My mass was deep and not where it could be felt. Mammogram caught it
ItsAlwaysMonday,"Very small amount of spotting, only lasted one day. Having a hysterectomy on September 4."
HarrySatchel,"Got itchy all over consistently for a long time. Tried all sorts of creams and stuff but nothing helped, and I never went to the dr for it. Then I started having trouble breathing. Thought I had covid at first then it got a lot worse, like I couldn’t walk up a flight of stairs without stopping to pant for air. Turned out to be a partially collapsed lung caused by large medistinal mass. Diagnosed Hodgkin Lymphoma."
tangerinedr3am_,"Lots of blood in the toilet, never in my stool. I shrugged it off as hemorrhoids. I had lost 30lbs in 6 months without really trying.. the bleeding didn’t get better. One scope later and I’m Dx’d with stage 3C colorectal cancer. Now I’m on my 3rd recurrence since 2021. The cancer just won’t fuck off. It’s still localized, but chemo isn’t working and I don’t have supplementary insurance to afford some treatment options. So I’m rawdogging cancer waiting to hear back from a clinical trial.."

No_Firefighter7063,"First time, a bump on my left shin, after some time it started to hurt. After some time I couldn't sleep from the pain in my shin and surrounding joints. Second time, a lump again. When I stood up, I could feel the blood in my leg flowing down to my foot, like it was stuck. It was, the tumor clogged up my blood vessel. The surgery took more than 7 hours."
daddonobill,Went for my annual physical and as a former smoker the doctor suggested a lung screen just to be on the safe side. Turned out lungs were fine but saw 12.5 cm mass on my liver. After a biopsy it was confirmed liver cancer. 2 months later i had the tumor surgically removed and am doing drug infusions every 3 weeks.
ltzerge,"Severe chronic lower back pain, constant vomiting, burning pain in my leg muscles, constipation. Melon sized tumor in my abdomen between my stomach and my spine. ER Trips were fruitless. Went on with worsening symptoms for months. I didn't actually get any progress until I went to a walk-in clinic and they ordered a CT. Immediately sent to the hospital for embryonal carcinoma"
Egoy,"Sudden intense pain in my lower back right side that radiated down to my testicles. Hurt so much I threw up. I presumed a kidney stone (never had one) I went to urgent care and they gave me an X-ray and saw a very tiny stone. They gave me a prescription for a med that makes passing stones easier, and a strainer and told me to come back in a week if I hadn’t passed the stone. I didn’t pass a stone and went back, they gave me a CT scan and that’s when they knew. The ER doctor told me I don’t have a kidney stone and made a phone call to the urologist right in front of me and told him he was sending a file to him and he needed to look at it asap. That’s when I knew. Several cats and an mri later I was scheduled to have the kidney removed. No biopsy prior because the kidney was done for anyway. The real surprise was when the pathology on the kidney came back for Ewing’s instead of renal cell carcinoma."
oneshoesally,"No symptoms. Passed a kidney stone, they did a CT scan to make sure it was all gone, and came away with a stage IV cancer patient. Mass on cecum, metastasis to liver."
LostInYesterday00,I was pretty much asymptomatic. I had some such as fatigue and weight gain and suspected and underactive thyroid. But i never thought it was cancer

ami_unalive_yet,Excruciating thigh/leg pain for 4 months. Diagnosed with Spindle Cell Rhabdomyosarcoma.
Delouest,I feel so boring. I had a lump in my breast. It was breast cancer.
Terrible-Big-Baby888,You want to feel “boring” in this community.. could be perceived as insensitive to those that have situations that are certainly anything but “boring.” I just hope you are doing better and that your breast cancer does not return. Cancer in any-way-shape-or-form is not “boring.”
erinmarie777,No such thing when it’s cancer. x
richard220160,"Pain in the ear after swimming, so nothing new to me. After a cold, a few weeks later a persistent throat and ear pain when I swallowed. Dentist gave me AB, dr gave me a stronger AB. Finally went to see ENT 25 april this year. He looked with a nasal tube and said that it was not good and send me in for all the tests at the main hospital. My file at that moment said Neoplasma supraglottis. (Throat near vocalcords stage 2, no nodes, no spreading) Three months later I finished 35 RT and now my file says NED and back in october for checkup,"
Pariah131,"My knee started hurting after hiking or running, after 3 months of no improvement and slowly getting worse I started PT and after 2 weeks of that it felt worse each time. PT recommended that I seek out MRI but before that I started having a stabbing pain in my side and blood in my urine. Dr. thought it sounded like a Kidney stone but sent me in for a CT scan. After that a flury of scans and surgeries. Stage 4 RCC with spread in both lungs, the back of my head, my spine, and my left femur which had been eaten away and they were afraid it was going to snap if I put my weight on it. 2 years in and I feel pretty good. No new growths, shrinkage of existing. Nivolumab shrunk up everything and while it's all still there, I did get a reset on my clock."
LoverOfPricklyPear,"I experienced conscious semi-seizures where my head would absolutely pound, I'd get an odd both sour and bitter taste in my mouth, and I would be unable to understand speech. I'd hear it as jibberish. Then, my brain would be unable to do some things, and memory was shot, the first 10 or so minutes following. Got referred to a neurologist who had imaging done before he met me (MRI and something else). Was lucky to get an appointment just one month away due to a canceled appointment. However, after my MRI, I was called just 2 days later and asked to come in ASAP. Yeah, monster brain tumor. Things were quick, following that."
Faunas-bestie,How are you doing now?
calebtheredwood,Zero symptoms. I went to the ER for a kidney stone and they did a scan. I'm a year and a half into stage 4 colorectal cancer and 33 rounds into chemo.
Faunas-bestie,"In Feb. of 2023, I was doing yoga and kept feeling a lump like I was sitting on a walnut. I told my doctor and he dismissed it as a pulled muscle, which I kind of agreed with. In May I insisted on an MRI. 25 rounds of radiation, resection of a 4 x 4 cm spindle cell sarcoma, Mets to my lungs, and six rounds of Doxorubicin and Ifosfamide all in hospital left me feeling healthy and cured by April of 2024. Cut to August 7th and a chest CT came back with new and worsening lung Mets. Still stage 4 and about to start maintenance chemo for life."
Terrible-Big-Baby888,"I was re-diagnosed in June. June 18th to be exact. Stage 4, working on maintenance chemo/hormone therapies to extend my life/quality of life.. I’m sure how we are feeling at this current time is quite similar. I’m struggling to be positive and hopeful but there are good days/bad days, I am sending you love & and big hug. Cancer survivors are some of the baddest, strongest, most resilient people I know. Thank you for sharing & giving me an opportunity to relate to someone,"
CJones665A,How long ago was this?
MachineSea6246,"My ""period"" became heavy. Once it landed me in the hospital for a few bags of blood, I looked for an obgyn. It took 4 months to get one who saw me regularly. After some trial and error to curb the bleeding for a few years, we lined up a biopsy and scope. My then employer cancelled my insurance and refused to reinstate it. They acted like I canceled it. I applied for Medicaid and due to an oversight on my part , it took a few months to get approved. Pain in my pelvis had started, I was not taken seriously. It took a few more months to get a scan. I was shipped to a hospital in a different city where they ran a few different biopsies."
Faunas-bestie,What did they find?
potionholly,"Felt as if I had an Adam’s apple, yet I’m a woman. Had an ultrasound- the US tech actually left mid-scan to get the radiologist. That was when I knew. Biopsy. 3.2cm mass on my thyroid- metastatic papillary thyroid cancer"
Mewllie,"For me it was a random pain in my abdomen, vomiting, blood clots in both lungs and legs, and two huge tumors on my ovaries."
Triptych1978,Sore on side of my tongue. Thought it was canker sore. Biopsy said different. Going for treatment consultation tomorrow. I believe it’s in early stages
HailTheCrimsonKing,Severe anemia and gnawing stomach pains. Originally diagnosed with bleeding ulcers but had cancer growing and didn’t know
Limp_Falcon_2314,"Seizures and becoming very out of breath when walking a block or two. When I went to the hospital I was told I had a tumor in my right lung that was almost cutting off the lung from being functional and that I had severe pneumonia in that lung with it being nearly 50% full of fluid. No wonder I couldn’t breathe. MRI showed multiple brain tumors and my other scan showed bone cancer in the spine and hip. That was a little over a year ago that I was diagnosed and given a very short prognosis. Happy to report they were wrong on the prognosis and today I am NED after two brain surgeries, whole brain radiation and radiation on my hip, as well as a targeted medication for my specific mutation (ALK+ mNSCLC)."
disastrous_affect163,"I started coughing up blood while showering one Tuesday morning before work, they found and biopsied a tumor in my right lower lobe. That was in 2017..."
erinmarie777,"That was a good question. You have gone through so much. I have always wondered what the trigger was the first time people sought medical attention. From what I’ve seen, people wait and see, and don’t go to a doctor unless they feel like they really have to."
Ok-Stop-3233,"I had a bunch of weird symptoms that may or not be related. I was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer after I had focal seizures that sent me to the ER (presenting as right side numbness/weakness). But before that for months I had developed ezcema (which ive never had before and havent had since starting treatment), my feet turned green???, i kept getting infections, and i had a random 104 degree fever for a few days and urgent care didnt know what it was. I also started lactating...? Really odd things that dont AT ALL seem related but i think my body was just really stressed"
Rare-Drive-457,"Commenting regarding my dad’s first symptoms. He was losing weight without trying & food/drink he said tasted rancid. After scans/tests, he was diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma to his lungs."
Just_Dont88,"I always had issues with iron deficiency, but one day my tests came back way the opposite. I then started getting my blood tested almost every week. Just my CBC because I knew something was wrong. That’s where I kept seeing my WBC, RBCS, and HGB just tank. I stayed tired a lot, couldn’t breathe, running fevers. Eventually I saw that I was neutropenia. Then camp the first of many blood transfusions. Saw an oncologist immediately on a Friday for a bone marrow biopsy, got the news that evening I had acute leukemia. Admitted to the hospital that night and started chemo that Monday. Been a month of chemo so far. Has not been fun but leukemia kills fast so I’m not too mad at the moment."
ElectricalMedium2230,July 2023 went to acute care bc of pneumonia. Never had it in my life. Something told me to get an x ray so out of 20 acute care places in my town I went to the only one in town w onsite x ray. She said you do have pneumonia but you also have this little thing in your other lung I’m ordering ct. pneumonia cleared in about 4 days I felt great!! Low dose ct in August confirmed suspicious- pulmonologist said 99% cancer and you will have to get you ready for a surgeon - another ct in August. Sept 1st bronchoscopy lung adenocarcinoma confirmed considered stage one. Pet scan Sept no other spots still considered stage one. Pulmonary FT test was great. Scheduled for right upper lobe removal Oct 27. Oh look there missed a lymph node on all these scans- confirmed stage 3. Chemo started in Dec. Keytruda started in Feb. no signs of disease progression. Will stay on maintenance Keytruda until Feb 2025. Always listen to that voice in your gut- I personally think that voice is God. Had I not listened no telling where I’d be now.
Caseyleehs,"I had low iron, a serverly swollen stomach for about a month or so, pain (like period pain), I couldn’t get rid of it even with the hot water bottle and pills. I ended up burning my stomach with the hot water bottle right before I found out. I thought it was endo because it was all down in that area. Oh and from the swollen belly, I couldn’t eat or drink anything much either. I ended up taking myself to the ER cause I knew at the very least I’d be dehydrated. They suspected ovarian cancer but once I had surgery to take out my extremely big ovaries (both sides were so big they couldn’t even tell which was left and which was right on ultrasound) they found out it started in my colon and spread to ovaries. So lost both ovaries and about 12cm of my colon. It was a bit of a shock but I didn’t have many symptoms tbh. I didn’t think it was cancer at all, I really thought I had a reproductive issue like endo or PCOS."
Unlucky-Nobody,lump above my collar bone. GP knew straight away it was malignant. She got me in for a biopsy the next day.
HorrorPotato1571,"Zero symptoms except some back pain but I attributed that to being 58 and having some age athritis. But I got a massage in Las Vegas. When I got home from flying, the pain in my left rib was intense. I went to the ER with a BP of 205 over 145. They couldn't find anything wrong. Took an xray of the chest, and saw a mass on right lung. Gave me some morphine which relaxed the BP. Did a CT scan, then a PET scan within a month. Stage IV Lung cancer with mets to brain, ribs and back. Stage II Esophagus cancer which didn't come from the main tumor in lung. Esophagus cancer is gone. Lung cancer is managed."
Amphetamemes97,"No symptoms, just a lump in my shoulder, it took a while for me to notice it. Once I did I realized it was growing very rapidly so I knew it was cancer."
BeanzMcG,"I had treatment for breast cancer in 2016 and had clean mammograms ever since. Mid-January this year I got this cough that I just couldn't kick. I went to my doctor over and over... it went on for months. I was prescribed cough medicine, stomach acid meds, nasal spray, and a chest x-ray. My doctor's office said my lungs were clean so I trusted them. I then received a referral to an ENT doc who prescribed vocal therapy and that was the final straw. I called my oncologist who immediately sent me in for a CT and then a PET scan. They found nodules in my lungs and lesions on my bones. Apparently an xray is not detailed enough. After a pelvic bone biopsy they discovered that my breast cancer had metastasized to my bones and most likely my lungs. There are nodules that are too small to be biopsied but they are fairly confident it's also cancer. I started some meds in the last month that are supposed to slow the cancer down and hopefully shrink it and give me more time. Advocate for yourself if your doctor isn't doing it."
amyina68,"I had some mild nausea and a feeling of menstrual cramps. They found some fibroids and I had a hysterectomy. The cramps went away but I still had nausea. They decided it was indiegestion and said to take more Prilosec. I did that for a while and my nausea continued. Sometimes I even threw up. Then I had a routine physical and they noticed a high liver enzyme. It wasn't that high though, so no one was very concerned. But I had an ultrasound and MRI anyway and guess what? I had a huge tumor in my liver! Meanwhile, I noticed some pain in my pelvis and found out I also had tumors in my spine. Stage Four, of course. I wish they had scanned me earlier."
wedgtomreader,"I have it felt well since treatment. I’m 56 maybe that’s part of it. Most people who get my cancer are much older and already tired I suppose. Constant fatigue and cognitive decline are my isuuses, but I am happy otherwise which is a blessing. I’m just glad to be alive."
FeralTee,"54 here. I used to be chubby but a powerhouse. I was strong!! Open abdominal surgery and cancer have helped make me weak.. I don't know what my outcome will be but if I can get through this with some hope for a future.. I truly hope to get some of that back.. My strength.. My endurance.. My ability to stand/walk for hours.. My brain.. And yes.. I hear you. I am never great these days but some are definitely worse than others. ""This too shall pass"" is becoming my daily mantra! 🤔😜"
beeboobum,"After a few months of being in a depression pit, I pulled myself out and am back to normal. Stage 4 ovarian. Finding the right fitness program and supplements helped me regain my energy and optimism. You will hopefully find what works for you too."
EileenForBlue,"I’m in remission I think from my original cancer but I’ve been in chronic pain since treatment ended. I have to see a pain management specialist. I’ve never regained my energy or all my memory either but some days are better than others. I think maybe being a little older, 57 at diagnosis didn’t help. You’re not alone. I just had a brush with breast cancer too so now I’m just trying to take things a day at a time."
onehundredpetunias,"I am 2 years out of treatment. I've read so much about it taking a year to get back to ""normal"" (whatever that is). For me, it's only been the past couple of months that I don't feel like a sick person. I've heard from other folks that it took them more than that year as well. I don't think I'll ever feel completely like I did before. But most days now, I don't really think about the cancer."
WhodatSooner,"I never got back to anything resembling good. I’m terminal, so surgery, radiation and chemo were all just attempts to relieve pain and maybe prolong life. They did both to a degree, but yeah, all of the things you mentioned are just the new normal. Some days better than others but we try our hardest to just keep living until I don’t. We’ve made some pretty good memories that we weren’t supposed to have a chance at. Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but if / when I think about what I was “before” it crushes my spirit. When I decide to just fight through the misery and the pain, we usually manage to enjoy life. We can’t do it every day, or even every month, but sometimes we can and it’s worth it. I’m blessed with a very special woman who plays by the official “through sickness and in health” rule, and she never overreacts in either direction. I think that helps. Just try to keep trying when you can and forgive yourself when you can’t. ✊✌️❤️🫵"
CrossMyLegs,"I’m terminal too, and you just described me. Less than a year ago I was a powerhouse, traveling and having a great life. In less than a year, I’ve lost most of my ability to walk, and only leave my house for treatment. It really sucks and I still have hope it will get better. Good luck to you too. 🙏"
PopsiclesForChickens,"Kind of. Like I feel like I could be well, but things keep pulling me down. Ended up my thyroid is messed up (no big deal, but hey, another pill). Just found out I have osteoporosis, right in the area where I got my radiation and I'm in my early 40s. That and I'm pretty sure my GI system will never be the same (colorectal cancer). I have to watch what I eat and a good day is probably 7-10 bowel movements. A bad day is many more. I make it work, but my goal during treatment was to get well enough to go on a backpacking trip next month with my daughter. I just had to cancel that because between the osteoporosis and the bowel movements, I just can't do it. I'll admit, I'm pretty depressed and angry about everything. Maybe it will get better, I'm 8 months into remission, but it feels like this is probably just my life now."
Queasy_Math6221,"Mentally my heads fried! Physically being dropped off a cliff into chemical menopause is horrendous , getting hot flushes sweat dripping off every part of your body and feeling so self conscious when it happens in a public place 😩 then thinking about your mortality if this fucker decides it’s not done with you yet ,yep cancers a bastard! It’s like an invisible stalker your always thinking about it even though you think you have got rid of it , then there’s the ones that go oh you’ve beaten it and have no clue that it’s never ending for you!! All I can advise is take time for you, appreciate the good times and try to have more as personally it’s made me think of what I want out of life and I’m trying to do more of what I enjoy even though those around me nothing has changed for them so they don’t think about time!! Which is really the most precious commodity"
Mental_Ad_7496,"Reading some of the answers I had no idea so many are going through the same as I am. All I hear about are the ones that overcame everything with their upbeat strong mindset. For me I went thru forced menopause directly after cancer treatment and couldn’t take hormones either. So I came from being a fitness trainer 20+ years full of energy and confident I can do anything I set my mind to—— to depressed, bloated, sleepy, and body can’t exercise nearly as long as I always have. So I don’t know what the effects are from: 6 months of chemo to radiation to menopause . I can’t retain things anymore and have short term memory issues. And people treat me that way including my husband. So dealing with family that no longer asks my advice or co-workers having not much confidence in you. My life has changed drastically after cancer in 2021."
tamaith,"I am good, I do tire easily but my strength is good - my back is feeling some pain but I did develop osteoarthritis during my treatment. I am sometimes wobbly on my feet because of the neuropathy and I have chronically itchy hands.I am dealing with brain fog the best I can by making lists and keeping a physical write in planner.The only pain I can complain about is the cramping that sometimes happens. This is not a charlie horse pain but my entire leg up my thigh, my pelvis and back are affected. The next day I am sore.Pancreas is conking out, kidneys are not doing well, digestion needs supplements to keep things going. All this is manageable with medications and supplements."
1LungWonder,"18 years post-treatment... every day I have some issue related to surgery or treatment.. teeth are horrible, extensive nerve damage due to radiation, not to mention breathing issues due to losing a lung. My doctor actually said to me ""Be happy you're alive! Most people don't make it."" It's not that I'm not happy, I would like a better quality of life. I have good days, great days, and not so good days. I take things one day at a time. I'm very happy to still be alive, yes.. but I guess I'm chronically ill and in pain.. it is what it is I guess."
akron-mike,"Thanks for the post and responses. I'm almost a year post treatment and constantly feel like shit. I'm glad to know it's not just me. At 58, I constantly wonder what's age related and what's treatment related."
Bobll7,"Not happy you feel that way, but glad to see I’m not alone. On top of it I got hormonal treatment that dropped my testosterone to zero. I feel weak and tired all the time and get hot flashes that wake me up at night all the time. It’s like I am stuck in a rut and wonder if I’ll ever get out of it."
3oClockHappyHour,"2 years from last treatment, I hurt. My brain hurts. My heart hearts. My legs hurt. I don’t sleep. I can’t read a book. Nothing is the same. I miss my old self, I grieve for her."
ClickAndClackTheTap,"Oh man, I’m really sorry to hear this. I hope you can find something that works to make you feel better soon."
T1red_buffalo,"Absolutely. I (42f) can do maybe a 1/4 of what I could just a year ago. I have stage 4 carcinoma syndrome as well as hundreds of cancerous NET’s filling up my liver. I was just part of a case study where they shot iodine into my liver to see if it’d cut off the blood supply to the tumors. This surgery aged me, I feel. Having to figure out my death wishes while still trying to be homeroom mom has aged me. The mental load of all my friends and families grief has aged me. Trying to figure out disability, has aged me. I got a cut on my hand three weeks ago and I’m still putting a bandaid on! I completely understand what you’re saying, op."
meow17ma,"It's been 2 years since my last treatment and I'm just barely started to feel better. There's the anxiety that any little thing could be the cancer coming back, as you mentioned. There's cognitive fuzziness and fatigue. The cognitive fuzziness can be something called post operative cognitive decline, which is worse in those who are over 65 and worse the longer the surgery was. (Mine was 6 or 8 hours -- I can't remember.) My doctor discovered that my thyroid was a little low and that I'm a little anemic, so we're treating that. I also was able to discontinue a blood thinner and reduce some pain medication, which helped even further with my fatigue. Is there a support group you could join? Maybe just being around people who understand could help. Could you ask your doctor to test for anemia and other causes of not feeling quite well? I still have my ups and downs, but very slowly it's getting better. Hope you can find something that works."
FakeNickOfferman,"I had chemo for CLL, which is mercifully not very aggressive, but I had Covid before that and pneumonia and a bunch of other stuff before that. The net effect is that I turned into a type 2 diabetic, have frequent hospital stays for DKA, and have all kinds of skin problems. I'm also weirdly sensitive to heat and cold. I just generally feel beat to shit. Hoping to pull out of it."
JenovaCelestia,"I’m almost 7 years out from my last chemo infusion and rads, and while I don’t feel perpetually sick, I do feel exhausted all the time and like I’m in my 80s. What’s more, chemo made my previously undiagnosed ADHD worse to the point I need to be on meds to manage it. I am also menopausal now and will never have human kids biologically. All of that being what it is, when I get sick, I get SICK. My immune system definitely has taken a hit and I get bronchitis at least once a year now. Nothing I can do about it; it is what it is. 🤷🏻‍♀️"
apryllynn,🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️🙋🏻‍♀️
ibakenaked,I have been NED 3 different times. And I always tell everyone I feel like a stranger in my body. I will say that meeting a Doctor Who did bloodwork for everything like every vitamin your body is supposed to have was very helpful. And we found that I have an absorption issue from all my colon resections.
ibakenaked,"So I was short on vitamin d, b12, and because of a hysterectomy my hormones were out of wack (obviously) also chemo caused thyroid damage lol so I needed meds for that 🙃🙃 but once we got that figured out I felt more normal - not 100% but way better."
Matelot67,"I know that I will never be the person I was before cancer. But I am physically and mentally stronger, more health conscious, more aware of how to live well, more appreciative of good days, less stressed by stuff out of my control. I have learned to appreciate joyful things, and to take advantage of travel, experiences and happiness. There are days where I don't feel like I did before, and that's fine. But I don't let that stop me from striving to be the best version of myself I can be. Normal is relative. Find the new normal."
GraymaneGent,"51 and out of my last chemo cycle for a month tomorrow, still have to go through surgery next month. I feel like the ghost of my old self, always moving, Always up to something, never caring about akes and pain untill they prevented me to reach my objectives. Now I feel weack, physical fatigue Is the new standard condition, struggling to focus on any mildly complex intellectual task, and scrutinising every new pain and sensation with fear. Here Is when will power needs to kick in, I'm forcing myself to push my limits a little bit (almost) every day. I try to walk longer everyday, may It be just to go to buy bread at the bakery down the road or to the post office etc. Being fortunate enough to be at my parents house in a costal town by the sea for this entire month, I try to swim 5 mitutes longer each day to regain muscle tone and stamina. I force myself to read at least 20 pages of a book every day to regain the ability to focus and do sudoku, crosswords or some kind of puzzle game or build and paint model kits for half and hour to regain problem solving ability and witt. I try to meet with people as often as possible, to regain social skills lost during the long time spent in hospital pitting myself and becoming angry at the entire world. Willpower is everything, things may not go as hoped in the future, but I will noy let every again cancer kill my spirit and witt before it kills my body!"
iSheree,"I was already chronically unwell before all this. I was born disabled and sick. Have developed autoimmune and cancer since then. That being said, the surgery to remove my thyroid and numerous cancerous masses from my neck and chest and the radiation treatment definitely made me worse in general. Living without a vital organ such as the thyroid is harder than I thought it would be. I haven't had chemo as my cancer does not respond to chemo so I can't really help there. I am not in remission yet, and may never be, but I am hopeful. I will never know if it's the cancer, treatment or autoimmune diseases that are making me perpetually unwell unfortunately."
Doctorphate,"I haven’t felt well since 2014. I actually had an occupational therapist evaluate me and the cognitive decline is very real. I’m in the 30th percentile for language skills and memory. My logical reasoning has improved to average to above average but without language or memory to back it up it’s not of much use. I haven’t been the same since doing chemo. I won’t ever do chemo again. If it comes back, I’m going to Cuba to get drunk and hang out on the beaches until im ready to go. I’ll come back and go to sleep within 24 hours of returning to Canada. No way am I doing another treatment."
LoriCANrun,"I think you described it perfectly, OP. I also never really feel good, but some days feel less bad. The brain fog feels like it’s worsening, my stamina is gone and fatigue is constant. Early(ish) menopause, aches and pains, bladder/pelvic issues. I am just past my 1st “rebirthday”, and am still trying to remain hopeful that things can get better. (AML - SCT Aug 11,2023)"
Constantlearner01,Well said. I am trying to return to a normal pre-cancer life but struggling with side effects of the chemo maintenance med. I was trying to enjoy a festival yesterday and I was feeling a bit nauseous and GI system out of whack so I can never feel real joy lately. I went to this same festival a year ago before diagnosis and it brought me so much joy. The pictures people took yesterday just remind me of how I was struggling to keep up with them.
Greater_Ani,I am so sorry you are going through that. But I also want to say that I went through chemo and radiation five years ago and felt very very close to 100% (like 99.99%) as soon as six months after the end of my treatment. The only lasting side effect I have is slight discomfort and slight disfigurement at the site of my radiation. Nothing at all from the chemo
Jojo197666,"100% Absolutely YES. I was cleared of stage 4 rectal (lung metastases) cancer 2 years ago, after being diagnosed in 2015, at age 38. I've not felt right since treatment. I never really felt that good before, which may account for the worse feelings, but sometimes I feel like such a hypochondriac. Always exhausted, generally unwell, ridiculous brain fog, never ending bowel aggravation etc etc... Not to mention the damage to my pelvis. Cancer is SH*T, and anyone who thinks it's over once you're treated and cleared has a lot to learn about how utterly life changing cancer is. I feel you, and here's a supportive hug 🤗❤️"
kitkatofthunder,"I’m so sorry. I have treated one patient with an active newly diagnosed pheochromocytoma and currently regularly see a second patient with pheochromocytoma in remission to evaluate for any progression of the disease. At this point in time, I can say both are alive. I say this from the perspective of orthopedic spine surgery, that being said, only 18 people in history of medical studies have had a pheochromocytoma with metastasis to the spine, so I have a very small study base to go off of when discussing treatment for patients. For patients in general, my best recommendation is going to a major facility like Sloan Kettering where the physicians actually see these things regularly. Pheochromocytoma, while rare, occur in about 0.8 in 100,000 people. There are around 333 million people in the US, these major facilities have regular interactions with these cancers. With you wanting to fight and having concerns for the experience of your physician on this particular cancer, I recommend a tertiary facility. Additionally, as you have a young son genetic testing should also be performed this cancer can be associated with some rare genetic conditions, if I had a child, I would want to make sure. While radiation can be variable with pheochromocytoma, I would have hope for chemotherapy. The 5 year survival rate for a pheochromocytoma without metastasis is 95%, while that sounds terrifying, I like to think of those as pretty good odds considering how many patients are noncompliant or have other issues. While it sucks, chemotherapy is usually much more effective than radiation, especially in the case of this particular cancer. Edited for grammar. As for discussion with patients. I have seen a patient with a cancer that we biopsied and we weren’t able to diagnose. The pathology report said it was something within the realm of an ovarian/endometrial cancer, but it wasn’t conclusive and had never been recorded before. There was a 2 hour discussion explaining how we would approach treatment with essentially no data to go off of and discussing how we would choose which treatment to approach and that we couldn’t promise or have confidence that it would work. She only came in at a late stage, and she sadly did not survive. But, because of the discussion she was able to choose to die in hospice surrounded by her family once it was clear treatment wasn’t working. While it is hard, it is sincerely important to have these conversations when we just don’t have data to back our recommendations. Thankfully, I would say this is not the case for your pheochromocytoma, while it is rare, we do have extensive medical studies performed on this cancer with n=3,000 or greater."
Little-Mrs-pheo,"Thank you for your detailed answer! I have metastases in the spine, too… just in case you want to have more data 😉 until now they are under control with radiation. Genetic testing was done and I do not have any of the known gene mutations."
timewilltell2347,"I’ll be honest, every time I hear about a royal or loved celeb getting cancer I secretly hope it’s related to mine, like at stage 1a or something treatable. It’s terrible I know. But it seems like that’s one of the ways rare diseases get attention and research these days."
Little-Mrs-pheo,I know what you mean…
forgottenoldusername,"I hear you. As a caregiver for someone with an ultra rare cancer I've lost count of how many times I want to reject well meaning comments from people saying ""Treatment has come a long way in the last few decades"" Or ""Outcomes are much better than they used to be"". Sure, for many cancers - but not her one, or many other rare ones. Treatment hasn't really changed since the 1970s. Outcomes have remained pretty much consistent in her group of cancer since the 1970s. Absolutely, cancer treatment for many forms of cancer has come such a long way. I'm so thrilled by that, over the moon happy to see the progress, and I'm so happy many peoples outcomes have significantly improved. But it's seldome comfort to hear, when you know the reality of living with an ultra rare cancer. But I don't have the heart to break the illusion for people. Just nod my head and say you're right. They mean well, they really do mean well."
tzippora,May you get the help you need.
phonograhy,Sending you and your family strength and prayers in your dark times friend. Your kid needs his dad for as long as he can have him. Keep fighting.
Little-Mrs-pheo,Thank you! Doesn’t matter anyways… but I’m his mum 😊
faeriekissage,Rare cancer team here. Not knowing anything about it is what sucks. I have no timeline no time frame no answers to my questions… just a you have a rare aggressive cancer and we’ve thrown 20 treatments at it but why not a few more?
This-Army6223,"Totally get it , I have a very rare and aggressive endometrial and yet another friend today is trying to send me another alternative remedy. I told her please don't. I've tried them ALL and nothing worked and all the regular medical stuff didn't either. People think cancer is cancer. Chris beat cancer so that means you can too. Never mind that every cancer and every body is different! Ugh it's frustrating. I finally just said ""look, it's me and God now and I'm at peace with whatever happens. If I get an unexplained miracle, I'm at peace. If I go home, I'm at peace. But I'm not chasing down the next snake oil or rabbit hole"". People don't understand that not all cancer is the same. Treatment for endometrial is vastly underfunded because it's so rare. Treatment for metastatic breast cancer HAS come a long way because it's so common and so well funded. People don't get it. They aren't all the same"
aligpnw,"I have an orphan cancer too. Thymic squamous. carcinoma. Most people don't even know what a thymic gland is, never mind that it gets cancer. I often get frustrated hearing about groups or charities or walks for people with ""regular"" cancers. It feels so lonely. ❤️❤️❤️"
BetterNowThks,"Rare cancer party. yay. Mine ovarian/fallopian cancer is from my freakin' dna. How do you escape that? I don't think you do, but my mom had ovarian cancer in the 70's and lived cancer-free to her late 80's so in my dreams this thing hits you once and leaves you alone for 3 or 4 decades. Probably not realistic but since almost no one has this RAD51 mutation, mu hopes and dreams seem as valid as what paltry science there is on the topic."
Terrible_Handle_8375,Yeah I was told my only option is to wait there are no available trials and I can only get so many radiation session and there is no info or case studies on any chemo that works best and they dont want to just use something that may short term be barely effective and long term effects caused later that to wait… also to get second and third options who also All shared the same outlook… wait and see what develops and no immunotherapy isnt really available that wouldnt potentially be more harm then the actual cancer so Im just palliative status.
Lucky-Abies-7605,"Rare cancer also here, aggressive UTROSCT. Tried chemo, radiotherapy and brachy and now been told lymph nodes swollen and I have lung nodes that they think is metatastic. Just waiting for the next CT scan to see what is going on. They don’t seem to know what to do with me, nothing so far is matching for any benefit with immunotherapy. They have sought second opinions and all they can come up with is chemo again if the scan results aren’t good. I live in dread of doing chemotherapy again. It’s nice to find a rare cancer community on here. Good luck to everyone in this rare cancer club."
charliehyena,"Penile cancer is rare (not ultra-rare but still), and has the added fun complication than people get uncomfortable imagining cancer in your penis :( It’s been awful and lonely going through this with my husband and feeling like a Guinea pig that the doctors are experimenting on"
thndrpffhfflbrd,"I am a caregiver for my boyfriend, and his ""subtype"" has only been recorded 3 times worldwide before. There's almost no information about it, no FDA approved medication, so no insurance coverage. The meds that they want to try are $12k a month. Who can afford that?! There's a similar medication in clinical trials right now to treat something else, but he might be eligible. It's still a shot in the dark. It all feels so hopeless."
DownWriteCancerous,"I got ""lucky"" with a very treatable cancer (Hodgkins Lymphoma). 3 years after I go into remission my mother is diagnosed with 2 separate breast cancers and then a neuroendocrine bone cancer. She has so may bone mets that the doctors have no idea how she is alive. I'm sick of people asking her about hospice. She wants to fight. She so desparately wants to hope and fight and keep living. The mets have reached her brain and now she's hospitalized with more pain that any human should have to endure. And she's had such awful care that she's gaslit herself. What is a 10 to someone who has experienced Hell for 2 years? I had to argue with the doctors and with her that no, she was not at an 8. Mom if your pain is so intense it is causing seizures, its a 10. It sucks and its hard and there is so little support."
GardenBusiness7725,In 7/23 my husband (64m) diag with pelvis osteosarcoma. They say it is very rare in adults. After 3 rounds AP (M too toxic for adults) had in 9/23 a hemipelvictomy and 3 more rounds in 12/23. New spots found in surgery bed in 6/24. Being told radiation doesn’t help yo much other than give some time.
Little-Mrs-pheo,I really want to thank everybody for sharing your own story and the wishes for the future!!
HorrorPotato1571,"I enjoyed having a rare cancer. I'm a bit of a research geek, and loved watching world leading cancer oncologists marvel at what I have, and how they would treat it. The cancer in itself isn't rare, its the combination which fascinated Mayo Clinic world class researchers. I have Stage IV Lung w Mets to lymph nodes, brain, ribs and back. But the primary lung had nothing to do with my Stage II esophagus cancer. Having two distinct cancers at the same time is quite rare. They could NOT operate on the esophagus as having Stage IV in full blown metastasis mode was not an option. They elected for chemo/radiation on esophagus, while taking targeted therapy for lung. There wasn't much data on how this would effect me, and how to take my targeted therapy pill if I couldn't swallow. So I was sort of a ground breaking case."
1kSuns,"My mother died when I was about the same age as your son. The one thing I really wish I had was recordings of her. At that age, it's highly unlikely for him to retain direct memories of you, so his entire knowledge of who his mom was, is going to come through the lens of someone else's memory of you. At least for me, that has always left me feeling very disconnected from her, because I don't know who she was as a person. Record little videos of you telling him about yourself, about your connection to him, and your hopes for his future. That way he knows and will always have your voice, your laugh, understand your interests, your quirks.. YOU."
CapZestyclose4657,This did make me outright cry
M-Any-Wulfe,^ This its what we did for my kids when their mum was dying.
littleheaterlulu,My mom got sick when I was in my early 20s and passed a few years later. Something she did that still means a lot to me is that she put together a photo album (with real printed photos and all :) There are photos of me as a baby/kid and photos of us together but also photos of herself as a baby/kid as well as throughout her life. I would've had the photos either way but it's just so special that she put together the photo book for me so that they're all in one place (and it's meaningful also that she herself chose the photos to be included or not). It's been more than 20 years and I still get the photo album out and browse through it. I just went through it again last week! I'm so sorry you're having to plan for this but it's awesome that you're thinking ahead about leaving some special stuff and I guarantee it will be precious to your son. Forever.
Dying4aCure,"Come on over to r/LivingWithMBC. I am eight years from diagnosis. Bones, Chest Wall, Lungs and Liver. There are people 40 years out. Not a huge amount, but enough. ❤️❤️❤️"
KittyKatHippogriff,About to mention that. 34 here OP. I am about 1.5 years in.
_coolbluewater_,Definitely professional photos - take them every 6 or even 3 months. Even after you lose your hair. I had stuffed animals made out of my sisters pajamas for her daughters with a message in her handwriting embroidered on the paw. Collect photos and stories from friends. I hope you have many years of NED or stable ahead of you. Wishing you all the best.
AnitaIvanaMartini,"I’m so sorry, my kids are grown, but my own mother was diagnosed when I was 8. That summer she filled our freezer with many dozens of her special Christmas cookies, pasta dishes like lasagna, and other treats. The first Christmas after she died, my grandmother, (her mother), put some of those cookies in the oven. We took a few bites and memories filled us with her presence again. We wept, and wept, and wept. I nearly choked on each bite. Frankly, it was painful and I felt guilty for hating those cookies because she’d put so much into making them. I’m definitely not doing that for my family. What I wished I had from her was stories! Stories about her childhood and life, but mostly stories about her and me together when I was too young to remember. I wanted pages upon pages of her opinions about everything! I wanted advice from her on life, love, every subject imaginable, from her favorite color to her best friends when she was young. I wished I’d had her advice on index cards— in her own handwriting, in a recipe box along with recipes. That’s what I’m doing for my kids— and best friend, and I’m doing it quickly."
currutia914,Here just to comment on what I’ve seen other moms do. I run an end of life consulting company where we talk about legacy items. Notes or cards for all major life events - handwritten if possible. Recorded voice readings of any children books. Especially holiday ones. Lullabies … For this- I really like the Yoto player cards … but also just mp3 format is good because they can be added to any playlists etc. Music playlist on Spotify The book “100 questions for mom”. It’s a fill in the blank book with prompts. The book “handwritten letters to my son” with idea prompts. Photos. Lots of photos. Videos- even more than photos because seeing you alive and moving is important. Special token or keepsake that can go on the Christmas tree and/or be displayed. Teddy bear made out of your favorite shirts and sprayed with your signature smell. Drawings from you. I saw one mom do 500 post-it notes with little drawings to keep in a “book” that she wrote a story for. I loved this idea a lot. If you’re religious - your Bible with marked versus for them to read or if not religious a list of books that you think everyone should read. Your bucket list- even if you don’t finish the items- they may want to do them after your gone together as a way to honor you. A list of how you’d like to be remembered and celebrated. Wishing you the best and a successful recovery but there’s value in planning and being prepared for your family . Big hugs
Yourmomkeepscalling,I’m stage 4 stomach cancer. At diagnosis my oncologist was noncommittal about me living out the year. 6 months later he said 10 years isn’t out of the question. I’ve got a 4 & 6 year old so I get being realistic. Hang in there.
BetterNowThks,"Im sorry, and i want you to know that Stage 4 can still mean many years of a good quality of life! The treatments are getting better and better, so try and focus on the plan ahead, and of course you can plan some things for if/when you come to the ens of life. Just think though, people often live longer with Stage 4 than even their doctors thought they could. Live your life. Be a mom, love your spouse, do life between chemo sessions, make those memories...be yourself and live life well. Do rely on friends and family to have your back in the tough moments...Keep talking to us, we are listening! 💕"
CJones665A,My prayers are with you...!🙏❤️
mousling,"I was diagnosed with blood cancer when my only bio kid was 3 weeks old. That baby is now a ten year old. I have been in and out of remission 8 times so far and am considered 'incurable'. So while I can't tell you what I would have liked, I can tell you things I have done, am doing, or plan to do. I recorded videos of myself reading children's books (Go dog go, where the wild things are) Made a little podcast with my best friend where we bullshit and talked about life and stuff Bought one of those 'read this after I die' books that ask you a lot of random questions and give you space to answer Wrote out the story of his life, how I meet his dad and step dad, his birth, my childhood, what I remember of my grandparents, silly memories of my life, family, and friends Printed pictures from my life and made a photo album with notes The most insane 2000 song playlist Basically I've done my best to leave as much information as possible for him about who I am as a person and what was and is important to me. What I stand for, what I love, who I look up to, my ideals, dreams, fears. What I found beautiful, touching, thought provoking. I know I can't leave him everything he will ever want to know about me but I've been doing his whole life and I'm going to continue to do my best. ETA: Please don't stop taking pictures of yourself even if/when your hair falls out. There are worse things than having no hair, like having too few pictures of someone you loved when they are no longer there to take pictures of."
Wyde1340,"I'm sorry you're going through this, but try to hold on to hope. There is a lot of research going on and you never know when the next best thing will come out (in the Lung Cancer world, we say we just have to live until the next drug/treatment comes out). Keep yourself educated on what's going on...advocate for yourself and support others newly diagnosed. Honestly, I think those 3 things are have what kept me going. Anyway, a couple of moms in our support groups have started to write (or record) letters to their babies. Another started an Instagram with their children's name and started taking pics of them together every day, with little snippets of information."
Rowlf_the_Dog,"Professional photos are a great idea. If you explain your situation, you will likely significant discount. Please look into clinical trials. Particularly at immunotherapy and breast cancer vaccines, that can help your immune system fight the cancer."
-Suriel-,"I filled out those story of my life journals, wrote birthday cards, cards for big events, made videos of me reading kids books, made photo albums, and made videos of me telling my daughters birth story along with videos of me telling her about her grandparents. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. I’m 39 with an 8 year old. I’m stage four and have been told I probably only have another year or two left. So I unfortunately can relate."
DerkSC,Prayers to you and to your family 😢
CelebrationConnect31,"Set of videos / letters with life advices or congratulations is a good idea. Use both as video tend not be as reliable as people think. I would add something that would let your son know you as a person. What hobbies you had, your likes and dislikes, quirks etc."
CapZestyclose4657,"OMG I’m floored at how thoughtful you are , I’m a grandma so grateful not to have faced this till now, and yet I never considered anything so creative and loving I could do for my grandson or my kids I definitely wouldn’t give up hope— I know someone who did trials years ago — was an unlikely survivor and her very own niece had the identical protocol offered as treatment 10 or so years later!! Both times it was successful even best case scenario wouldn’t it be so wonderful if, as moms, we left something so thoughtful for our kids? Not just a box of photos & files for our kids to go through? My heart & prayers are with you And ANY idea is a valuable one!"
alfredoatmidnight,When my grandfather died some of the ladies from his church made all the grandkids quilts out of his old suits. It’s my favorite blanket!
Rihmakala,I feel bad for you :(((
pfflynn,Check out StoryWorth as a way to capture your memories. Send you a question by email. Reply to answer (or do on the web). It can then be printed out as a book. I am just a customer but found it has been a good way to capture stuff about me might kids might not know or remember. Especially interesting I hope for my 4 grandkids.
mnoe1922,"im sorry to hear that, I will pray for you and your family."
st4bma5terars0n,I'm making a spotify Playlist for my kid.. all my most favorite songs. hopefully spotify lasts a while. I'll probably write it down somewhere as well just in case.
Prestigious_Bid5643,"I am so sorry. Dammit, this is horrible. Dont give up hope though. Fight as much as you can. Dont go down without a fight! I am not in your shoes as of right now but what I have already have planned in the event my news is bad is a yearly Birthday and Christmas video. As many as I can do for every year for my children as they grow up. Speaking to them as if I am right there. Also one for their graduations, marriage etc. Keep your dreams and hopes up! Look for clinical trials? Everyday with our babies is a day worth living. Repeat ""I am Healthy, I am Strong. I can not be Defeated!"" Its amazing what our mind can do, send positive signals to your immune system. Praying for you and your family 🙏🙌"
FamousVeterinarian00,"This post hit me like a truck!! I'm so sorry! This is horrible. I don't understand why this disease (or any other diseases!) even exist. Years ago, I remember I read a book, wrote by a mother who was diagnosed with Cancer when she was pregnant. The book is about all the things she wanted to tell her daughter, a little bit about how to face life years by years without her. I know write a book isn't as easy and not for everyone, but maybe you can make an email address, everyday (or once a week, twice a week, whenever you like) wrote what you want to say to your son and send it to that email. You can also send photos, videos, etc. Once your son is old enough, I hope he can feel your presence through those digital memories. You can talk to him through it. Video is very great! Record yourself talking to him, whatever you want to tell him, hug him, kiss him. Then send the video to the email. You can also make another email for your husband. Or put them together in one email (both for your son and husband)."
WtfOrly,Record a video or series of videos just telling your family how much you love them and maybe talking about some treasured memories.
This-Army6223,"I had a friend on another group in 2010 who was given 36 months with metastatic breast cancer in several places. She had two babies. She ended up living about ten more years. Hand in there mama, a moms desire to live is the greatest of all because of her children. Praying a great treatment for you to knock this down and out for many good years with your family!"
bros402,Come into the r/cancer discord and meet some cancer friends. I would recommend recording yourself answering the Great Questions
Necktie_Ninja,There's is a movie called My life. Where the dad has cancer. Told he won't live to see his baby born. We'll he does he makes videos for his kid. To watch like first kiss things like that. You just need a phone and some usb stick. But never give up hope. These Doctor's aren't God. You can beat it see your kid grow up.
AdultingDragon,"I won’t comment on how utterly heartbreaking this is, but just know you’re in my heart. Videos of you walking through family recipes and traditions videos of your describing your favorites things, activities, foods and places, and why they’re your favorite a bag of your things with your scent on them hand written notes as you’ve already suggested if you own your home, plant a tree and take photos of you and him in front of the tree and then instruct your husband to keep the tradition going every birthday come up with a new tradition for just you and them. Something along the lines of “when you miss me, do this and I will be by your side and will listen to you” videos of you singing family lullabies or telling family lore videos of you talking about your school days videos of you talking about family inside jokes, nicknames, and crazy stories wear something in all of those videos and leave it behind - can be a ring, a necklace, a jacket. Something he can keep. letters or videos acknowledging how hard it is for him to grow up without him mom and not know her letters or videos acknowledging your own regrets over the milestones you will miss as his mom"
mlcarv-21,"Besides all the memories, stories and photos, If you have a hobby (whether creative or sport…), put together a book or box of favorite recipes, drawings, stuff you’ve made, objects you collected.., whatever it is, that are special to you."
MuchChampionship6630,Oprah Winfrey’s show featured a young Mom like you doing videos for her child to watch through their lifetime . I always remembered that woman even now years later Here is the video —- Hug to you . https://youtu.be/V6zfghwqybs?si=rQ3ZHg64vln5ohpl
dammKaren,You can record online at Familytree.org You can build a family tree and tell him about your and your husband families. Post photos of you and him together. Write him a. Letter or notes so he can see your hand writing. If you have a song you sing to him you can record that. Photos of you now and as you fight the cancer stay positive Sending you good vibes and hugs From someone who lost both parents these are thing s I would have loved
slejeunesse,"Big hugs to you. I am 4 years out from my stage 4 diagnosis and i'm doing just fine! Don't count yourself out, and don't stress too much about making every moment count or anything like that. Parenting a toddler is still hard!! I've made sure there are pictures of me with the kids. Just candids, nothing fancy, and I print them regularly. Do things YOU like and enjoy with your kid. If you're a letter writer, maybe do a sweet birthday card every year and stash them someplace safe. When you're farther into treatment you'll have a good idea what you're looking at re: energy, time, etc."
Beautiful_Limit7801,"There’s a book I saw someone give their mom recently, called “mom, I want to hear your story” - it contains pages with loads of different prompts for you to write your responses to and include stories about your life etc. It’s almost like a journal of your life and it’s something your son will always be able to keep hold of. I’m sure you could find it online - I’d definitely recommend it! It’s a lovely idea. Love and best wishes to you and your little one ❤️"
OnlyTheGoodDieYun,A lot of new treatment options out there please fight hard! Prayers to you !!
Lostboysma,🫶🏼 🙏🏻 💞
muireann85,"Hey, I’m also stage 4 breast. Was diagnosed at 2 weeks post partum. I’m 10 months in now. There are people who have lived decades with this. Do you mind me asking your sub type? There is a sub Reddit for us."
Lookyheregoober,"Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by sub type. The cancer type?"
Purple_Olive_5358,"I'm so sorry for your diagnosis, and since you got a lot of responses with ideas which is great, I just want to say that God has the last word 🙏🏻 and I've seen here in Reddit a lot of success stories of people that has lived a lot of years on stage 4 cancer!🙏🏻 I don't know where you're getting your treatment but MD Anderson in Houston is one of the best hospitals for cancer treatment. Prayers your way and big virtual hugs, God bless 🙏🏻"
TimelyCaterpillar538,Please please look into the Jane McLelland protocol and find a doctor on her website who practices the protocol. She is 20+ years out when she was given weeks to live. Do not give up. <3
Electrical_Paint5568,"Well said. ""You've got this"" sounds trivializing, and doesn't leave room for the patient to feel all the range of emotions that come with being sick. I would also add, don't say, ""let me know if there is anything I can do"" because that doesn't work. Either you don't actually mean it or you're putting the onus on the sick person of the mental load to figure out what they need that they feel comfortable asking you for. When we get the diagnosis, we are too exhausted, and too much in shock to be able to make those kinds of decisions. Instead, if you really do want to help, offer options: I can help you with A, B, or C, which would you prefer? ""I would like to send you a care package, would you prefer food delivery gift card, or someone to clean your home, or snacks, or just cash?"" ""If you need help getting to your appointments, I can drive if you if I'm available or pay for your Uber. Would you like that?"" And when you contact the sick person, don't just ask how they're feeling. Share something normal. A meme. A cute cat video. A joke. A funny picture of your dog. Anything actually normal."
Quick-Employment-229,"I dislike it when people ask how I'm feeling on the bad days. I know they genuinely care and want to know if I'm well, but it makes me angry anyway. How do you think I'm feeling, I have cancer. But I like it when they send me a meme or something, I don't feel like reporting on my illness always and I really hate the ""oh no what happened"" if I do tell them I'm hanging in there. So I love your last tip."
RelationshipQuiet609,"I think this is an individual issue-when you have survived five cancers and been in the “fight “ for 13 years like I have been it truly is a battle. I can’t even count anymore how many tests, appointments, blood draws, hospitalizations, that I have been through. When you start at a lesser stage and end up in the club nobody wants to be in-it triggers all kinds of feelings. I find that people don’t know what to say-if they say things like you mentioned I don’t take it to heart! It’s like when someone says “How are you”?in general (without cancer) I think do they really care how I am or are they just being polite? I don’t think people are trying to be disrespectful. It is a fight-it’s a fight for you life. It never ends when you have cancer! I don’t like the saying either about losing the fight-but that’s what’s ingrained in people! So cancer is as individual as we are. Our journey is our own. I would rather not take these things to heart but concentrate on making my day a little bit less about cancer and little bit more about life."
trixiemushroompixie,"I completely appreciate your approach! I can’t imagine your experience, that’s the thing with cancer it is so individual. In our situation with stage iv pancreatic unfortunately we don’t have 13 years to gain perspective or a thicker skin. I thought I could maybe just provide some insight and impact some of the communication for our immediate situation. I know there are folks who embrace the fight language and made point to acknowledge that. I hope your daily balance continues to be more about life and less about cancer. Thanks for the insight ☮️"
Impressive_Course_44,"I completely agree with your post. As you mentioned its up to each individual. I liked the “you got this” phrase. My wife and I used it a lot. I was the one with the cancer, and mine was “curable”. To me the phrase was more about surviving the treatments then it was about beating cancer. Like I have to go in every day for proton treatment, as the side effects start to build up, it can be tedious. To me “I/you got this” just simple meant I can get through the 20 mins on the table today and not let it knock me down. However, my best fried recently passed away due to cancer. I never used that phrase with him. I let him lead the way in how we discussed his cancer. He was the most positive guy you would have ever met. He faced his condition with a smile on his face, knowing that he only had a few months to a couple of years at best. Luckily he survived more in the year and a half or so range with a great quality of life all for except the last couple of weeks. However, he was very careful on how he spoke about his cancer and his future. You could tell he was positive but not hopeful."
trixiemushroompixie,I appreciate the you got this between you and your wife. It paints a nice image of support and encouragement in the moment. Positive not hopeful is a great observation. I think that is exactly what we are. When you know your are terminal and treatment is to extend life and maybe push things back gain some quality in that time the focus is different. We definitely focus on the positives keep our perspective a bit more narrow and in the now. I am sorry for the loss of your friend and I hope for the best outcome for you and your wife.
liamsmom58,Very well said. Thank you. I’m saving this for days when I need a reality check.
LoverOfPricklyPear,"Oh, I feel ya. I'm ""cured"" and have been finished with my brain cancer since around 2018. While cancer free, I am still, and always will be mentally disabled with impaired memory. Now, 5ish years past isolating my impairments and learning how to work with what I got, there is no further improvement to be made. I mean there was huge improvement after learning what parts of my mind worked and what didn't, but that's the best that can be done. Still, to this day, I have people ensuring me that I make things improve. ""Just don't quit!"" ""Keep working at it!!"" I just sigh and blatantly explain to them how, ""no, I'm at my stopping point. You have NO CLUE where I started. I have improved sooooooooo much from my post-op, low-ass starting point. It's amazing where I am. I can never be 100% normal. You have no idea."" But alas, they stay sure things can still improve...."
Save-crochet-1956,"Thank you for putting what I am sure many of us feel/or have felt, so eloquently."
PetalumaDr,"Beautiful thoughts. Thanks for sharing. I might counter with the fact that most battles are not ones of our choosing, Ukraine, Gaza, Bhagavad Gita,... There are no winners in war, just relative degrees of loss. Cancer is but one manifestation of our simple mortal reality- we are born, we suffer, we die. Nothing particularly special about cancer in that regard other than it often puts us in the 80% of people who know their time on this plane is limited (as opposed to the 20% who just don't wake up some morning). I completely agree that it isn't about winning or losing ""the battle"" but whether one feels gratitude for the life they have had. The quality of a life is not measured in years but in connections. Sitting here with my terminal cancer that I will never ""beat"" I am amazed at the life I have had and can feel nothing but gratitude. I hope the same is true for you my friend."
No_Cap_9561,This!!!!
AltSilverSurfer,"I have witnessed a lot of people with cancer, most young, just kids. Most of them knew nothing about battles, they only wanted to be well and not suffering. They only wanted the disease to go away and live. So, I usually just cheered with them when they were feeling well and the disease was fading, or cryed with them in the bad moments."
trixiemushroompixie,That’s all you can do. When I had cancer to get to palliative care you had to walk through Paediatric Oncology. My heart broke but it also was inspiring. There were still smiles and giggles amongst the pain. I always thought to me self if a child has to face this then I can.
ant_clip,"I will be doing MAID, I am not ready yet but at some level I can relate. There is a sense of dread that is hard to describe. I suspect when you are ready, you will know it deep in your soul. Preparing is not the same as doing, preparing gives you the option should the pain be too much. You don’t have to decide until the moment you take the meds. I wish you peace."
wm_ghostcat,"Oregon does have MAiD, so does Spain and the Netherlands if I want to travel there for a couple months. Portugal is in a limbo (I have a residency visa but haven't been living there for over a year and doctors allow it from what I gather when I was there but I don't know if the bill has gone into motion yet) and India.... does not have it but I can refrain people from treating me against my will once I am out of my senses and I'll actively have to seek the solution myself."
Advanced-Bluebird747,Love and strength to you❤️ Wishing you the power to make the best decision for yourself.
ImmediateButton1497,"I’m battling with the decision too. As time goes by, I just get more and more uncomfortable. Whenever I open up to my doctors about it they just normalize it and tell me it’s part of the dying process. I can ask for my death to be medically assisted at any time but I have no clue as to when to know it’s the « right time ». I tried asking family and friends for advice but they always tell me it’s my decision to make and mine only. How and when to make that decision remains completely obscure to me. It is scary. Do we wait until the idea of pain gets scarier than death? Should we do it before and avoid all that miserable painful stuff? I have no idea. I feel like there’s no good answer to this. It sure can’t be rushed. Is there a moment of the year you like the most? I know I’d like to die in the fall. October is my favorite time of the year. These days I question myself a lot and I try to focus on the things I love. I don’t want to schedule my euthanasia based on fear but instead use it as a way to celebrate the things I enjoy. I hope you and I find light and peace on our journey"
ant_clip,"My oncologist referred me to palliative care when I brought it up, that was how I got started with palliative. Palliative has talked to me in detail about how it works, what’s involved, how I would feel and of course referrals so when the time is right I know who to contact. Having that support is extremely helpful. Maybe skip the oncologist and talk to someone from palliative care. I am not yet at the 6 month mark, I am incredibly fortunate. I think of it as a safety net to spare me from the worst, not a contract. I might never need it, I might go quickly and quietly but it’s comforting to know it’s an option should I want it."
FragrantEcho5295,I wish you peace in whatever your decision is.
Littleshuswap,I'm sending you love. May you find peace in your decision ❤️
anchoronmysleeve,"Hey there, I'm an End of Life Doula in Canada, and I'd be happy to help you with support and coaching if you'd like."

Puzzleheaded-Bid683,"Love to you. Whatever decision you make for yourself, will be the best decision. ❤️"
Heraghty07,All the best to you. New Mexico also has MAID..
pinkpeony90,"I think about this. I have no reason to live frankly. I’m 34, but I have lost everything. I don’t have a penny to my name. I don’t have family to support me either. I’m on so many pain meds that I don’t feel much of anything anymore. I would like to die, but I’m a Christian therefore it feels as if I am basically committing suicide. It’s something I struggle with. I really want to go this route, but it’s just that, my belief is God will take us when it’s our time, but I’m losing all faith and quite frankly I’m am mad at God. Like why? Why this? I hope you are at peace with whatever route you choose. I am tired. I am ready to go. But my boyfriend will be really sad. That’s the only person I’m holding on to."
GravityPools,Hugs and love and strength to you.
Acrobatic_Ad4941,I didn’t know that was legal anywhere in the USA
mthoody,"Physician-assisted death (“Death with Dignity”) has been legal in Oregon since 1997. Today, legal in ten states plus DC."
PrestigiousLion18,"I know exactly how you feel. I've been fighting my cancer for 4 years already and nothing has worked. My cancer just kept coming back and spreading throughout my body. The numerous surgeries I had, the insane radiation treatments I had to go through (about 60 rounds total), the immunotherapy, and the two trials of chemo all didn't work and aren't working so far. I'm still on my second trial of chemo, but my cancer is still spreading. I don't wanna die, but I'm also tired of being in pain and I'm tired of being a cancer patient. So I get it. I hope nothing but the best for you and that you get to live your life to the absolute fullest."
This-Army6223,"I stopped chemo. It wasn't working and the option I had to knock it back was hard chemo again. I said no way. If it was just gonna give me extra months forget that crap. I thought I'd die on taxol the first time around. No way. Now I'm active and living well but on hospice. The tumors hurt and have grown a lot. But I'm still here. This is a decision that you have to make, nobody else. Just like mine was. I remember talking to my mom about it, and she said nobody can make that decision except you. I was honestly sick and tired of being a patient, sick and tired of being with the cancer center constantly, sick and tired of low blood counts pain and all the other things that come along with cancer treatment. I did it for a year and a half and basically had nothing to show for it at the end of that. So my situation is a little different than yours. It sounds like your chemo has somewhat kept it at bay so you have to make the choice to keep going with it and can you live with the side effects, or to just say no more. There's no one that can tell you what is right or wrong except for you. Nobody who hasn't gone through this can possibly understand what it's like. I'm really tough and I can power through a lot if it's got a good end result, but for me it was just going to prolong things. I think if I was given the option of a treatment that would possibly eradicate it and put me into remission , I would do that. This is a discussion you need to have with your oncologist as well. My oncologist was really great. He told me he wanted to put me back on taxol since then the other chemos were working, and I told him no. He said,""talk to me"". I appreciate it that he was so open to listening. I told him that there was no way I was doing taxol again. It was crappy in 2010 when I did it for breast cancer but it was far more crappy and I thought I would die when I did it last year for endometrial cancer and I'm not doing it again. He listened to me and didn't try to change my decision and was completely respectful of that. He did make sure that I knew that no treatment meant that the disease would progress. I told him I wasn't afraid."
False_Grape1326,I chose to refuse chemo after watching my brother suffer - its a brave choice but the quality of life vs quantity especially feeling so awful - i feel like more support could be shown to those of us who choose this route especially at young ages ❤️🙏. Your soul knows best
Nebuchdnzr,"Sounds half empty from a stranger on the internet, but with all my being I wish you all the best."
ant_clip,"It is your choice, it is your body, your life. I would just suggest give yourself the space to change your mind. I am not doing treatment. I see my oncologist every three months and have remained open to conversations. I wish you the best, and no you are not selfish."
meluckyalive,"I just want to thank you for sharing your experience here. It takes courage to stay on treatment and it takes courage to stand for what makes sense for you. Especially when it goes against what people around us expect. I suspect many of us ponder these decisions and for many reasons stay on treatment long past when we want. Stay strong and believe in yourself to the end. Signed, fellow patient."
sleddingdeer,"This is your decision and you’ve had enough experience to understand what your choice entails. You need to tell your doctor first and perhaps your oncologist can speak to your parents for you or with you to help them understand. It sounds like your parents aren’t going to give you their permission, but you have reached the age when you don’t need it. This is never going to be easy for them to accept so go at your own pace. They will come to terms with it. They have no choice. I’m sorry. Chemo is awful. Some regimes are absolutely unbearable. I’m really sorry you got this raw deal. I think you are very brave for listening to your inner voice. I wish you peace and a miracle."
Sunshine12e,"Definitely your choice. People who have not gone through the treatments for cancer, cannot understand. I often wonder why I even bothered, as this is not the life that I want, however at least I am around to help out some people who need it. Now, though, I completely understand why my grandmother chose zero treatment, after watching my grandfather go through it all. Now, I will also say, that it is likely that your family will not understand and you may decide to stick around longer for them, or you may not."
Arsenicandtea,"I don't have cancer, honestly not sure why this was a notification, but as a mom I wanted to respond to you. As parents there's this deep pain at the thought of our children dying. They've been spending years fighting to keep that pain away. It's honestly selfish because they're causing you pain so they don't have to have pain. Here's my suggestion, say to them ""Mom, dad, I know you love me. I know you've been fighting hard to have the long life I should have had. I know you want to see me grow and live a long life, I want that too, but that's not the life I am going to have. I can't know how long my life will be but I can decide on the quality of the life I have. What I have to do to keep living doesn't make a life worth living. I am going to stop the chemo and count my life by the quality not the quantity. I want to spend however much time I have left building happy memories with the people I love. There's nothing you can do about me dying, but I hope your last memories of me are happy ones knowing I've had a good life and lived it on my terms. I hope you choose not to spend whatever time I have left fighting me and angry at my decision. I love you both so much."" There's a quote from Dr Who that I like: ""Every life is a pile of good things and bad things. The good things don't always soften the bad things but vice versa, the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things or make them unimportant."" I wanted to send you all my love and let you know you're strong and brave. You know what is best for your life. I wish you safe travels on your journey and hope it's longer than you expected and filled with joy"
RelationshipQuiet609,"Immunotherapy is not without side effects. Just because one person doesn’t have any doesn’t mean others don’t! I had a severe reaction to it that landed me in the hospital for a month, I almost died-so make your choice on what you believe is the best for you. It’s your life and you have every right to choose for yourself! Best of luck to you with your decision!"
pfflynn,It’s a choice every patient may face.
brujabonita,"Supporting you from afar, it’s not easy and only you can decide what is best for you. Wishing you peace and strength in all of your decisions and I hope others provide you with the same consideration and respect, OP. ♥️"
magicpenny,"I completely understand where you’re coming from. I had a friend who had adrenal cancer, her treatment was very difficult but she reached remission. Then it came back. She refused treatment the second time and passed away a few months later. I told my husband if that happened to me I probably wouldn’t go through the initial treatment because I didn’t want to suffer like that. Then I got cancer. A completely different cancer, multiple myeloma. It’s very treatable but there’s no cure yet and I’ll be taking medication the rest of my life for it. Things are okay right now. But, I still refuse to suffer. When I reach that point, I will be faced with the same decision you are facing now. You’re very brave to even consider it. This decision should only be about you. Don’t allow yourself to suffer to keep anyone else happy."
Shadowkiller00,I support you and won't question your decision.
Howaboutyoumakeme,"Have you tried any other form of treatment, one with potentially less impact on life? Such as immunotherapy? I know when I had it, I had no hair loss, sickness, etc. and lived an almost fully normal life. The worst side-effect I personally had was reflux. Either way, though, I totally understand the feeling of not wanting to continue. I had the same thought many times. I'm really sorry you're going through this OP, an issue nobody should have to face! EDIT: Some people seem to be misunderstanding what I wrote, so I've edited it slightly. I. I'm only asking a question too, I'm not telling the op to do anything. Just wanted a clearer picture."
msr_aye,This was already my only option especially after I got another form of cancer (started a second kind of chemotherapy for that and that itself became stable after little over a year). And not to sound selfish or spoiled but I frankly can’t do this anymore.
Diligent-Activity-70,I’m willing to bet that their doctors have looked into all appropriate options. They don’t keep people on chemotherapy for that long if there are other treatments available. Immunotherapy is not an option for many of us.
EtonRd,"Your individual experience with immunotherapy is just that. Your individual experience. My side effects from immunotherapy had me in the hospital three times for a total of about four weeks. I understand that you’re trying to help but telling people that immunotherapy has much less impact on life when that is demonstrably untrue for many people, and you don’t even know if it works for their cancer is not really helping. It’s misinformation. I’m sure I’ll get absolutely slammed for saying that, but I don’t care. Spreading misinformation is bad regardless of whether it comes from another cancer, patient or not."
Plaza-Riot,Listen this is why I support either assisted suicide or hospice. Sometimes there isn’t anything you can do expect prolong your life and it is not always a life worth living because it’s so full of medications and pain. I know you’re not asking for it but I support you in this decision because I’ve watched someone suffer through cancer and treatment when they didn’t have to. Best thing that can be done is pain management and like whatever the hell you want to do with the rest of your life. I’m glad you’ve made this decision for yourself.
Disastrous_Hour_6776,I believe in your choice 110 %. My husband is on chemo & I hate seeing him so weak. I have made my mind up that if I ever have to do chemo I will not take it .. it’s too hard on the family . I will take what is needed for pain & let nature take its course .
Dancinghogweed,"Be a stuck record with them. This is your life, your choice. You've tried other paths and they do not suit you. End of. Respect my choice please. Your parents love you no doubt more than anything else in this world and do not want to lose you, nor you them. Cancer unfortunately doesn't care about that. Part of my work is supporting people living with cancer with reflexology and hands on healing work. I talk a lot to people at all stages. Can tell you as/when I get a cancer diagnosis I am not doing chemo. I hope you can be as well and as comfortable as possible for a good while. X"
LeetheAuthor,As a two time cancer survivor I partially understand only because only had 4 mega chemo treatments before surgery. I was just in hospital for bowel blockage surgery due to cancer surgery. I was so sick and weak and it almost broke me. Life long chemo would be daunting. Only thing I can say is you are young lots of new immunotherapy coming if can hang in might be an escape. Alive you can love and share ( and yes suffer) but dead you can only be remembered. My heart goes out to you.
BaptizedByBitches,"That is absolutely your right as a human. And a decision that can only be yours and yours alone. Most people don’t know how bad chemo gets - in ways that affect every different aspect of yourself. Only you know where your limits truly are, and what is best for you. Consider it carefully, and take some time to reflect. After that, you do what is best for you. I respect your decision. We love you."
sleepyoverwhelmedmom,"Sending love, support, hugs and solidarity ❤️‍🩹 This shit fucking sucks"
Few_Strawberry_3384,"I’m not sure why this post got recommended to me but it was so I will try to say something. Kurt Vonnegut lost a sister to cancer. He said her dying words were “No pain.” I think it is up to each person to decide how much pain they can and will endure. I wish you strength and send you love. Here is what Vonnegut wrote: “My only sister, five years older than I, died when she was forty. She was over six feet tall, too, by an angstrom unit or so. She was heavenly to look at, and graceful, both in and out of water. She was a sculptress. She was christened “Alice,” but she used to deny that she was really an Alice. I agreed. Everybody agreed. Sometime in a dream maybe I will find out what her real name was. Her dying words were, “No pain.” Those are good dying words. It was cancer that killed her.” from: http://www.unmeaningflattery.com/blog/permalink/2007-04-22-God-Bless-You-Mr-Vonnegut.cfm"
ClickAndClackTheTap,Im sorry this is a choice you even have to make and I applaud you for w sting to be straight up with your parents. Best of luck in your journey going forward.
Ok_Jellyfish9787,"As a mom to a newly 18 year old who has sworn off any more chemo, I painfully understand where you are coming from. Be gentle with yourself and continue to keep the conversation open when the time comes to discuss options again. Your feelings are valid. Sending love and support your way. ((Hugs))"
Virtual-Service7511,Hi I’m ment to have treatment in the next 2 weeks but Iv decided not to have any Iv told my family how I feel and I think you need to sit them down and tell them you have free will and it’s your life and it’s your choice and say to them that how it’s going to be they will come to terms with it at some point but if you don’t want it anymore then you will just feel that you no longer want to be around them so you must make them see I wish you all the best no matter what you do and remember it’s your decision no one can make you do anything
No_Cap_9561,"Good on you for making your own choice. Way too many people are pressured by their families to enhance with treatments that ruin quality of life, giving very little, if any, extra time or chance of remission in return. It’s part of what I call the cancer industrial complex. Treat treat treat. Takes some maturity to face the facts and not fall into this trap. Frankly it takes an amount of acceptance most people just aren’t capable of."
TimelyEntry9877,Sending hugs 🫂
Mdmac1015,Perhaps go to a Counselor or Therapist- talk with them and explain your situation. Don’t go extreme or go dark- calmly state your life and what you want to do moving ahead… Then share it with your loved ones
Positive-Ad-6514,"Your body, your choice"
jAuburn3,I’m so sorry reading this and what others are going through. All the best
QuietProfanity,"I wish my brother could have decided this but he moved in with my awful parents when his brain tumor recurred and after surgery he’s in no position to make his own medical decisions. They’re just going to put him through surgery, radiation, pills and PT and whatever else is offered while they cash his VA and SS disability checks. He’s sedated for an MRI right now bc he is too disoriented to lie still for it right now. I can’t stop feeling like I’m going to throw up. My ovarian cancer sucked but I hate being the loved one more than I hate being the patient. You’re so damned young to have all those years of this, and I know, so damned tired of hearing that. It’s not fair. I’ve stopped posting and attending my online support groups because I’m tired of losing people. I cannot imagine how tired you are. You deserve, after all of this, to choose your next step. You deserve so much more but at the very least, you deserve this. I wish you a peaceful and comfortable ending on top of one hell of an adventure. I hope you spend time choosing and doing what you love. Thank you for sharing."
Hot-Train7201,"Since everyone here is encouraging you to stop, I'll play devil's advocate and suggest you keep fighting to stay alive as long as you can. There is no certainty that you will be taking chemo for the rest of your life; immunotherapy is coming a long way and they're even testing out possible cancer vaccines. The sheer speed of breakthroughs we are finding with AI and molecular science means there's a very real chance that cancer could be cured within our lives! If you stop chemo and die, but then in a decade or so a real cure does come, then your parents will be left wondering what could have been if they kept pushing you to take the chemo. It's your choice in the end, but don't assume that nothing will change or get better; you have a better chance of surviving cancer than any of your historical peers who lived when AI, immunotherapy and molecular science weren't possibilities for them."
Due_Location6730,The family pushing my grandfather to continue with his immunotherapy I kept stressing to him it wasn’t our call I could see how sick it made him he finally had enough and after trying six months has switched to hospice care he’s doing some better and the nurses think he may live another 6 months he was initially given six months that ended in July at the end of the day this is your decision and your parents will hopefully never have to know first hand what your going thru if you decide to tell them just tell them that you’re the one going thru this not them best wishes for you
ComparisonTerrible11,"First off I’m so very sorry for the cards you were dealt and I commend your strength and that of all of you who have faced this painful disease with grace agaisnt all odds, with that said, I’d like to hopefully get some perspective, my wife was recently diagnosed with DCIS and we’ve been at odds regarding what course of action we would take with two conflicting opinions from two doctors, one who wants to be conservative remove the affected areas only, followed by radiation and hormone therapy and since she’s now high risk she would follow more frequent check ups to monitor recurrence, the other feels since she’s young, she should just have a double mastectomy and put this behind her within 6-12 months with reconstructive surgery…that’s what I want her to do, but she’s afraid of the invasiveness of a double mastectomy and the less invasive doctor really sang to her tune, however I don’t think she explained to her the downside of cancer therapy through radiation and the anxiety that she will now have to live with as she goes in for screenings every 6 months…my question is, given the opportunity, would you guys opt for an invasive surgery or the less invasive procedure followed by radiation therapy? Just really want to know which way to best support her, but this is also very much my life and that of our 2 year old 😞"
msr_aye,"I really can’t speak for her. It might not sound like what you want to hear but absolutely nobody understands what it’s like to be her right now, not even the rest of us with cancer. Our experiences and troubles are unique to us even if we may have the same or similar conditions. What I will say breast cancer is a bit different from cancers where you don’t lose any body parts. That’s already scary, like losing a leg. And she’s a woman so she may have an emotional attachment, or feel like she might not be pretty or loved anymore during that period where she doesn’t have a chest. Maybe she just doesn’t want implants (while definitely not to the extent of checkups you should be checking occasionally for excessive scar tissue or breast implant illness). If she’s heard out both sides and decides that what she wants, support her 1000% even in the ways she may not realize she needs support yet."
Similar_Track_4488,I finished treatment for breast cancer...19 chemo infusions surgery and then 27 radiation zaps. Not interested in taking the hormone suppressing drug for 5 years. I am 68 and want quality over quality of my remaining days. ✨️
PetalumaDr,"Clearly not a rash decision, and clearly your call. The only thought I have (which may already have occurred) is whether you have spoken to a Palliative Care doctor about your goals of care and making sure you have a smooth transition from chemo to just managing your symptoms for the best quality of life you can have in your remaining time. I seriously doubt any sane physician or informed loving parent would try to stop you after 7 years of chemo."
No_Signature_7609,Only you know how your body feels. No one has the right to tell you to undergo chemo if you don't want to.
[deleted],Comment deleted by user
sleddingdeer,I find this comment cruel. This is OP’s life and they have every right to make decisions that are best for them. In OP’s case being strong means choosing quality of life over quantity because that’s what’s in their heart.
Super_Pin_8836,"This is definitely something serious enough you should make a list of the pros and cons. I would see a therapist before doing it because depression can greatly affect good judgment. As dumb as it sounds, there are a lot of people who do not know they have depression, and they they make life altering decision(marriage/divorce/abortion/drugs) and later learn to regret it. I’m not saying you have depression obviously because I do not know you. But even if you don’t, a therapist would be helpful. I would question if maybe you are making this decision because you feel like you have no control in your life and this is a way for you to take control. There are other ways to take control of your life. Seeing a therapist would be a really big start."
Additional-Oven-5001,"Im not sure where you are but I would suggest getting your self into the top cancer hospitals in the world Specifically sloan kettering, they specialize in cancer and are fairly advanced in child Hood cancer, they may have options for you that are not available to your local hospitals, If you are at a cancer hospital and there only option for you is on going chemo then again i suggest getting out of there finding a different hospital with more options."
msr_aye,i go to one of the best hospitals for cancer in the country already. my parents considered getting me experimental treatment at one point but it was very expensive and i would never let them go into debt for that.
SDamon83,"I just read this article about a man with lung cancer who they gave him months to live. It was metastatic lung cancer. he chose to get off treatment and he moved out of the US to Greece and drank red wine, ate healthy Greek food and worked in the vineyards. Since that diagnosis he is still alive 40+ years later. Miracles do happen. Follow your heart. Your higher self knows best. Everybody‘s cancer is unique and different. They’re alternative remedies, that you can take that that destroys cancer. As I said miracles do happen and I think a power greater than ourselves is in control. Spirituality is very important to me. I hate the Targeted therapy pills that I’m taking that have left me pretty much a homebody. I don’t work out anymore and I’m gaining so much weight. Currently, I’m suffering from acute inflammation where I have so much pain all over my body. Also these pharmaceuticals mess with brain chemistry so we have brain fog and we don’t think as sharply as we used to. I’ve had a little bit of chemotherapy and I hated the effect two days after when I felt like just killing myself. What chemotherapy does to the body is horrible. I think Western medicine sucks. And the science community as well. This day and age they should have something much better that can eradicate cancer. But chemotherapy and the targeted therapies are BIG money makers for big Pharma. My Oncologist stated that I have up to seven years to live. I laugh at that. How do they know?? They are not God. If they found a cure for cancer or offered cure for cancer they would go out business. I swear that Pharma is like a mafia. May God bless you and guide you in your decisions . Sending love and light to you.🙏🏻♥️🙏🏻"
orbeyonde,6 years of chemo (96 rounds so far). I don't keep doing it for me. I keep doing it for the ones I love. Please think of those you love before you make this unalterable decision. Good luck. FUCK CANCER!!!
False_Grape1326,With all due respect- all cancers all chemos all bodies and all situations are different. I downvoted only because this guilt shaming of quitting and refusing frontline is rampant everywhere on cancer support forums. Perhaps she wanted a pep talk- perhaps she wanted to know she’s so strong and it’s okay to prioritize palliative QOL measures. Chronic disease is very personal and isolating. Im so happy your body responds well and its great reminder- your heart knows your purpose ❤️
47squirrels,Not supportive at all.
No_Cap_9561,"That’s the decision you wanted to make. It’s respectable. You should also respect, and support, people who make a different choice. The last thing OP needed here was a guilt trip!!"
underwhelmed88,I was stage 3. Cancer had spread. This was 12-ish years ago. Sending you best thoughts
AncientSmoke241,"Had the same experience. Stage 4 melanoma. Doctor called me while I was alone in my office. Spent a couple of hours crying. Then had to wait all afternoon to tell my wife when she got home and then explain what it meant because she was mostly in denial. That was in May. I want you to know, the shock, terror, and angst ease up. Heck, I can sometimes go for half a day or more without thinking about it. This moment will pass. You'll soon adjust and get a plan with an oncologist to fight it. That's the next phase. Good luck, you can do this."
eyeswim2,"I'm sorry , that must be scary and how awful to be alone to get news like that . I'm sorry , my heart goes out to you , (((hug))))"
ant_clip,"I know the feeling myself. I also know how it feels to be alone when going through it. I am stage 3/4 metastatic adenocarcinoma unknown primary, you aren't alone. What you do is you live, you are here today so for today you live. Your medical team will help you to navigate the treatment options or whatever is appropriate for you. A therapist can help you to navigate the emotional aspect of the journey."

Sending you big hugs 🫂 and light ✨️🪷"
CelebrationConnect31,"Drink or just go to sleep. Sending virtual hug, evne if it seems meaningless"
Amarie_Vanya541,"I am sorry to hear that you are facing this, and I am sorry that you are facing it alone. In the past 10 years I've faced cancer 3 times, recurrent ovarian carcinoma - now in this third time with cancer I've had chemo twice, last year and this year. We are all different so what works for each of us may be different too, but I hope sharing what I have done so far may help you. ACCEPT: We can't change it. This is what God [or life, or the universe - whatever your belief system is] has thrown on our plate, so the only thing we CAN do is deal with it. It helps if your belief system, as mine is, includes believing that we are never given something that we cannot bear or cannot deal with. So whatever it is we are faced with, we are actually able to bear. GET INFO: Discuss options with your doctor, and search for info online as well, check that info with verifiable and authentic sources. Get second and third opinions either formally or informally (doctor friends, if you have them, other patients who have gone through the same / similar situation). GET SUPPORT: Friends, family, faith groups... the closer, the better and the more physical the better. What I mean is there may be times when you are going to need someone with you, so find this. If you can't have many physically to support you, then, you can explore what I did which is to supplement with paid options such as private nurses, maid or similiar. While getting support, remember not to ask from people more than they can give. Everyone has their own limitations and you can't force people to be there for you. They are either there or they are not. AVOID UNSUPPORTIVE PEOPLE: People who scare you with horror stories, pessimistic people and people who try to sell you stuff and people who think YOU should entertain THEM. STRATEGIZE: put a strategy in place that would help you cope better. Are you working? If yes, can you sustain in your present job or do you need to search for better options to earn income? I'm sure you've already realized that illness comes with hidden costs. Do you have children that you need to care for and be responsible for? Can you cope with that or do you need (3) SUPPORT in order to do so? Do you have EPF / Insurance etc? Are you eligible to tap on these nest eggs if you need to? I applied for full EPF withdrawal 2 years before I was supposed to be eligible and it was approved. I used that money sparingly but it has helped me set things up so that my entire treatment process is now easier. CONTINGENCIES: Whatever you decide as your strategy, have multiple layers of backup plans. I have 3 main sources of income, and a 4th I can tap on in case the other 3 is insufficient. My support system also includes backups in case my main support is unavailable. HANG IN THERE: This is the most challenging thing and in order to be able to hang in there at all times, (3) SUPPORT is important. You need a go-to for those times when you're crumbling or when you feel like giving up or at the end of your rope. I have weekly online groups that help me, as well as my husband and other family members who buck me up when I am down and shower me with love at all times from near or far. My husband reminds me that I am a patient so I have to be patient. My family and friends send me their prayers and well wishes. Build such a group for yourself if you haven't already. Other options would be a professional counsellor / psychologist who specializes in this area. Ask your doctor if there are support groups and keep in contact with other cancer patients so that you can help each other stay strong. HAVE FAITH. Believe that whatever is ordained for you that is the best thing. Believe that there is an opportunity for beauty and joy in any kind of existence, even in illness. Whatever you are going through, God / life / the cosmos has opened multitudes of doors (opportunities) for us to transcend our reality and attain true enlightenment, so that nothing can touch our well-being. I hope some of these help."
CloverChill,"I went from stage 1 to stage 3 in a matter of a silent minute. (No one actually said anything at first it was just there in my paperwork) So I understand your concern. Like me you probably were super hoping surgery would remove it all and that'd be it. Unfortunately it just means our fight isn't over. You HAVE to trust in your care team that they will get you set up for what is best in your exact situation. If you haven't yet, I would look into a councilor/therapist who specializes in difficult medical situations and get set up with them so you can vent this all out. That's what I am doing and it helps a bunch. Personally."
aligpnw,"I feel you. The shock of it, being so positive after surgery and then just getting knocked all the way back to the beginning. Take your time to grieve, don't try to be strong for anyone else. Then, start making a plan, get into therapy if you can. Get a second opinion if you want to (mine changed my plan going forward and gave me some extra peace of mind.) You're not alone ❤️"

I'm angry about that . I'm sorry I feel inadequate to say anything people do beat cancer . Sometimes the industrial medical complex don't have all the answers , but others possibly do . I just wanted to reply so you didn't feel so alone at this time ."
cartel7956,"That doesn't mean you lost the fight, just that you have try something else and a lot of options are available.. you can do this. In the meantime live in the now because you can't control everything and worrying will accomplish nothing.

Defiant-Aerie-6862,"Sending hugs to you, I’m sorry you are going through this"
This-Army6223,"Pathology shouldn't show the stage, stage is determined by the location of the tumor(s) and size. If cancer spreads from its original place to an organ or bones that is called stage 4. That being said people can live with stage 4 cancer for many years depending on treatment , etc. I'm sorry , nothing sucks more than bad cancer news. Push your doctor for next steps! If it's just in one location often they can surgically remove it or radiate it."

Although idk how treatable it is honestly, bc none of the treatments have been working from the start. It's just been prolonging my life, but not getting rid of my cancer. So far my cancer has spread throughout my body."
denju,"Firstly, sorry for what you're no doubt going through, hope you're going as well as possible in the circumstances. I was diagnosed with non-hodgkins lymphoma at 30. Came as a total shock as I was fit and otherwise healthy with no family history of cancer. Went through chemo and it's about three years later now and I'm in remission and recovering. It's a hard thing to go through, but talking about it and sharing experiences is a really helpful thing. Hope all goes well for you."
AnxiousDiva143,I am a little older at 38 and also have stage 2 breast cancer. Just want to say I’m sorry you are dealing with this. There is another group called breastcancer that may be helpful to you as it has been very helpful to me. There are one people around your age on there as well.
2much2cancer,Please check out First Descents. They do adventure trips for young adults with cancer diagnoses. I went on a week-long kayaking trip through them earlier this year and still keep in touch with the group from my trip. I'm even organizing a community adventure with them next week! It's a great experience.

I am being monitored closely due to some fluid on the right side where it was and where I had radiation. Radiation I completed in May. It is possible I am about to have a skin biopsy to make sure it is not coming back. It could be just from radiation. I was stage 3b and 3 lympnodes positive"
beedlejooce,"Yep! There’s a whole lot. Scarier part is a lot of the ones I see popping up recently is colon/colorectal cancer in people under 35. That used to be unheard of! That was always an “older” person cancer. Not anymore. It’s the food we are putting into our bodies is literal poison. Even “fresh” produce. Mass sprayed with chemicals, everything being GMO’d. It’s quite sad. Cancer pretty much touches everybody one way or another nowadays."
Legitimate-Ad-8504,"Drink a ton of water the day before. and of course, after for many days. Don't spend the day before resting! You're going to be in the chair for 6+ hours the first day so you can sleep in there. You may want a driver your first time, but you don't need one. For me-the steroid they give you to combat diarrhea may make you hyper for the first day and a half, then when you go to get your pump removed (46 hours later)you will begin to be very sick. It will last about 2.5-3 days, then you will feel better and better until it's time for chemo again. Please let them know if you are unable to get out of bed except for using the restroom. They are not sure how much of a dose you need so they give you the max for your weight. You can and should request they lower it if you just can't handle being that sick. They don't know what the exact amount of chemo will help you. Sorry, I've never been a good writer, but we have the same stage 4 colon cancer. Most likely it has spread somewhere which is why it's stage 4? I had Fluorourcil also. They paired mine with Oxilaplatin (sp?). The moment they gave it to me I could no longer handle any temperature other than room temp or hotter in my mouth of on my hands. Anything cold feels like you just swallowed cactus. It's weird and I'm not exaggerating. When I would touch something cold, my fingers instantly froze. Weird. I had to wear gloves when it was 65 F outside. Hopefully, you have help at home because after you start getting sick, you don't know how sick you will get. Take your temp, drink as much water as possible, if you are thin-please start eating anything to help you gain weight."
MisterVee321,Thank you. That was just the kind of help I was looking for.
Jonesno11,"I have appendix cancer, but they treat it like colon cancer so I had the same chemo regimen. I still have problems regulating my temperature. I always have socks on. And chemo brain is real. Still."
greywar777,"im going to address something different that I wish I had LISTENED too. People will abandon you. Not all, but a surprising number. You will discover who truly loves you or cares about you."
Human-Iron9265,Absolutely true. It may surprise you who actually sticks by your side through all this.
Yourmomkeepscalling,Just the 5FU? Expect some moderate nausea and fatigue. Alternate between the compazine and zofran at the slightest hint of nausea or even preemptively. Loss of appetite so eat up in between treatments.
MisterVee321,Thanks.
wedgtomreader,"It’s a long road - more of a marathon than a sprint, enjoy the good days and understand on the bad ones that each new day can be different. Do what you can and give yourself some slack - endeavor to walk as many days as you can, a little movement and being outside did wonders for my mind and body. Best of luck to you."
aRealKeeblerElf,Ask about side effects. I got cisplatin and it damaged my hearing. I didn’t know it was a possibility! I now wear hearing aides
CaroSCP,"Once you've had your first treatment, at the next (and all subsequent) meetings with your team, tell them about any side effects you're having, however small. If the nausea & stuff is a lot, they can tweak the levels they give you to reduce it. You'll be given anti-nausea medication, if it isn't working well, there are other options. If you're worried about something unusual that's happened body-wise, let them know, they'll tell you if it's not anything to worry about, if it's a common side effect and, if necessary, will be able to give you a lotion/potion/pill to help. Tiredness will be a thing. Try & keep a note of when you experience different effects, after a few cycles you should be able to spot a pattern & work life around it. Good luck on your journey"
Legitimate-Ad-8504,"Also, you got this! I kept working full time. I got chemo on Thursday, worked on Fri, sick Fri night through Sun, woke better on Mon. Please ask me anything at all. I hope I helped some!!"
PopsiclesForChickens,That is definitely not everyone's experience. I was on FolFox (which includes 5FU) and could not have worked and was lucky enough to live in a state with paid short term disability. Although I guess it depends on your job and if you need to keep working.
terryterryd,"Don't feel bad if you can't work. I have tried. But the fatigue is disarming. It doesn't help when sleeping time is restless with nausea. I am on Oxaliplatin and Capecitabine. Doctor signed me off for six month: I am genuinely finding it tough. Trembling, tired, cold glass cactus spikes on touch. But it could be worse - that's how I stay positive."
mthoody,"I’ve had 40 cycles of 5FU (fluorouracil), but always paired with either oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or irinotecan (FOLFIRI). The last 32 of those cycles also included immunotherapy (panitumumab). I suspect just 5FU would have fewer side effects than what I experienced, which were reasonably tolerated. Not fun, but tolerable as far as chemo goes. One reason to give just 5FU is concern over the patient’s ability to tolerate oxaliplatin or irinotecan or an immunotherapy. How is your health other than the cancer? The 5FU is administered from a wearable pump over 46 hours. You may also receive a bolus dose on Day 1 via infusion. Experiment with clothing options for wearing the pump. I use a fleece vest with large inside pockets to hold the pump. I have a colostomy, so I couldn’t use the belly band they usually offer. They also offer a case with a strap, but I preferred my vest over the case with a strap (I still use the case, but I cut off the strap)."
JohnDStevenson,I used a small carabiner to hook the bag for my pump to a belt loop.
driftingthroughtime,"Welcome to the worst club there is! Do you have a partner? If not, I would ask a few good friends to check in on you. You might want to do that anyway because so much falls on your partner, your household chores especially, but don’t forget the emotional toll they carry. Talk to your oncologist and nursing staff. They will be able to help you with the side effects. And, if the side effects are harsh, they will adjust your dosage. Stay as active as you can. Is this course the first step for you? They often like to give a few rounds of FU as preparation for surgery. (They are looking for clean margins around your tumor(s).) And, last, I will say that I found a support group to be helpful in supporting me emotionally and with treatment and hospital tips."
sdr541,I used marijuana for stomache pains etc
Glass-Vermicelli9862,Don't eat right after or right before. I took pills and first time I took it I was hungry. I ate and then took chemo pill. Was sick all night. Just keep drinking water and let your spouse or partner that maybe shouldn't cook anything strong smell. I feel bad but my wife made bacon and I woke up. Went to bathroom and just there for hours. I told her that she needs to cook somewhere else. I felt bad but I was terribly sick and just stomach acid came out it was worse feeling. I have brain so it could be different
Heatseeker81514,"Not everyone loses weight while on chemo. Edit: Mine is breast cancer, so it is probably different. It's non-hormal, however."
lumpytorta,Complimentary pic of my chickies ✨
Aware-Marketing9946,Can you reach out to anyone to secure help for the future? I went to a Vocational Agricultural high School. It's not far from me. Maybe you can see if they can help? When I was in high school we did help people (volunteer) with their livestock. It would be a joy for you to keep them if you could. I wish I could help. I'm a farm girl.
Itsametimmy,"You’re never alone there’s always people to reach out too if you need them, I certainly have felt the same way at times since my diagnosis 4 years ago and still do sometimes I’m 28 now and don’t feel any closer to the end of my cancer journey than when it started 😒 if you ever need too talk don’t hesitate in shooting me a message."
lumpytorta,"Thanks I really appreciate it. I’m so tired right now but I can’t get myself to sleep. I’m just feeling all sorts of things both physically and emotionally right now that it’s freaking me out. I want to continue living, things were just starting to look good in life. What type of cancer do you have?"
inkrml,"My wife and I lost our two dogs over the past 6 months. They were very old. I (36M) was diagnosed stage 4 colon cancer in April and I was struggling with the loneliness. We adopted a new dog from the shelter and it has been a huge help. There are days I struggle to give him the attention he needs, but it gives me something to push for. I hope there is a happy middle ground where you can keep your chicks. I’m sorry you are going through this and if you ever want to talk, feel free to send me a message."
lumpytorta,Thank you ❤️ so many new puppies in the comments makes me want another pet but I already have two puppers as well haha i want more 🥹
phalaenopsis_rose,"Your chicks are lovely! I don't think you got carried away; you just went on with your life and thought you could have this one thing to yourself. Perhaps there is a middle ground? Keep the chicks but get into contact with someone who could potentially give them a good home? I hope for many good and healthy days ahead with your chicks. Cancer is scary, but life doesn't stop. Try to live the best you can each day."
lumpytorta,Thank you ❤️ I’m going to see if I can potentially re-home them in the event that I pass away and enjoy my time with them as much as I can. Hopefully I’ll be able to see them lay eggs at one point
One_Yam4941,"I was diagnosed with kidney cancer at 43. they removed my kidney and I was fine until this year when they found it had spread to my liver and lymph nodes. in the years leading up to this year, my wife struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideations. I didn't take care of myself last year like I should have and sometimes I really feel like if I had, I might not have been in this situation. I'm in a clinical trial at penn testing a new drug along with opdivo immunotherapy (after 6 months of treatments my tumors have shrunk by 50%). the best advice I can give is take care of yourself and give yourself grace when you feel down. cry when you need to, but don't overdo it....after a certain point the crying isn't helpful and just starts building your cortisol levels, which lead to stress. eat healthy, see a psychologist /therapist if you're not already, cut shitty people out of your life. if the doctors aren't doing what you think is best, get yourself to a place where they are. I am fortunate to live in Delaware, and I'm close to Philly, so I was able to get a 2nd opinion at the university of Pennsylvania. not all doctors and hospitals are created equal. if those chicks make you happy, keep them! if you are worried about what might happen if you're not here, talk to a local animal shelter and see if they can help in the event the worst happens."
Fossilwench,sending you infinite juju and love from another ovarian CC w/mets patient. my dog and horses ( and plants ) have kept me sane ( my ex left me just prior to starting chemo ) . your tiny t-rex family is wonderful. please continue to enjoy and care for them. please reach out to fellow feathered Dino groups online for camaraderie along with potential option if you need to rehome ( or temporarily board for care ).
Takes_A_Train_2_Cry,"After I (36m) finished radiation I got two puppies. I started my first rounds of chemotherapy shortly after and a few months later was, basically, rushed to surgery. Spent some time in and out of the hospital, longest stay was 24 days, and was re-staged from 3 to 4 post op. They gave me another 6 rounds and that wrapped up this past October. Getting the dogs is one of the better decisions I’ve made in the last couple of years. Having something to be responsible for gave me a lot of drive to push through. Even with some major life altering side effects from treatment and surgery, I still can’t imagine doing things differently. Do your best to stay in the moment and take the news as it comes. If you’re feeling well enough now, start building the coop, they won’t stay young very long. Also don’t count yourself out from being able to care for them. It will give you a reason to stay active f you need more treatment. Best wishes OP."
lumpytorta,Thank you for sharing your story with me. ❤️ This gives me hope that maybe just maybe this cancer can be treated.
K1PH03ABC,"I hope everything is okay from your end, Constant communication with family and friends helps my mind take away from all the stress and anxieties. I try to move around the house as well doing basic chores but the constant thing that keeps me calm is talking To God and raising all of my worries. Praying everything would be okay soon"
NotoriousEvilGreek,Have you tried a support group
Key_Cheek4021,"Yes it is. I got diagnosed with hcc last year November and as time pass I feel lonely. Everyone is moving forward and while I am just here waiting. But let’s hang in there, be happy and we will beat this shit."
melissahj,I got ovarian tumor too and I’m 24 yo. Totally understand the loneliness. What is your diagnosis? Sending good wishes to you and your chickens
misery2mystery2magic,I’m sorry for what you are going through. I know one woman three years out from her ovarian cancer even though there were complications. Try to keep hope going. And don’t worry. Someone will take the chicks if necessary. ❤️
sunrise_parabellum,Please keep your chickies ♡ we gotta find joy where we can
OnlyTheGoodDieYun,I feel this. I was in an on and off relationship for a number of years. Been completely abandoned during my cancer battle. Honestly it prob made me stronger. I’m praying for the best outcome for you! I hope you are happy peaceful and cancer free soon!
madlyeverafter,"I wish I could help. Keep fighting, I was lucky and had very early colon cancer surgically removed. I have to walk with a cane due to the radical weight loss but fight on. Keep on fighting What’s the quote, Galaxy Quest ‘Never give up, never surrender’ 🩷"
SpaceCat2323,"Oh these babies are adorable!! Definitely not carried away, this is still your life and you still have control over these things. Enjoy these babies every minute! In regard to planning, maybe reach out to a trusted (local depending on where you’re located) farm or you can ask wildlife preservation groups if they would take them. Or visit some of these places, bring a family member or friend and whichever place you like best, ask the person you trusted to bring in the event this happened to you, if they would bring them there for you to rehome them Keep your head up high, one love ☺️"
maple204,I feel super lonely too. I don't feel like anyone I know can relate to my experiences. I have trauma and anxiety. I should be feeling happy to be alive and clear. (Clear for now) I'm just so unhappy with what the treatments have done to my body.
onebodyonelife,"Have you heard of rubbing Iver.mectin in your tummy button every night as an additional treatment for cancer in that area. It's quickly absorbed and very cheap to buy around £10 a tube. This will last 3 or 4 weeks. It may be worth a try. I belong to a few groups, not on here who have had promising results. There are support groups on tele/gram. 🤗"
inkrml,That’s a lot to deal with all at once. I hope life sheds some positivity on you soon. I’m sorry you are dealing with all this. I (36M) was diagnosed stage 4 colon in April. Lost two dogs in the past 6 months that we had for 12+ years. I hope you find your way back to NED and can find peace with the rest of the things you are going through.
CorporateNonperson,"Thanks. I really appreciate it. Sorry that you are dealing with similar puppy stuff, and of course the Stage 4!"
Yourmomkeepscalling,"You’re John Wick as far as the cancer is concerned. F that shit up. You did it once and can do it again. Sorry about your pup, I’ve got two 14 year old dogs and I know their time is limited, but they’ve also had the best lives a dog could dream of, and that’s all that matters. I’m also a divorce lawyer and what I’ve learned over the years is that getting out of a non-supportive relationship is the beginning of self improvement, I see it time and again. A good therapist is worth its weight in gold, and essential to self growth and care. This disease sucks, and I have all the respect for those of us who fight our way through. Hang in there."
CorporateNonperson,"Thanks! We (spouse and I) are both lawyers, as well, although she is in business instead of practice. I did one divorce around 2008. Never again. I don't see how family lawyers do it."
montanawildcat,"Well, I was drunk the day my mom got out of prison. Stage 4 RCC here. My pups are getting older, I’ll be 50 in November. My biggest fear is not outliving my mother. We lost my sister in 2021 and that devastated her. I’ve been extremely fortunate that my wife has been my rock. But she knows I’d do literally anything for her and my step sons."
CorporateNonperson,"I feel you. Sorry for the diagnosis! My mom is 71, not in great shape and aside from me the only close relative she has is my great aunt who is in her late 80s. Last go round I had a conversation with my wife about helping her out and what that would look like. Thia time depending on the prognosis, I'll probably set up a trust to benefit her, then to assist my siblings from my dad's second marriage. There's a bit of a plot twist because the spot was apparently on last year's scan, same size, but wasn't on the report. Probably not a huge problem, because NETs are slow growers and my last one was Stage 3 but Grade 1. No reason to think otherwise for this one in terms of grade."
AncientSmoke241,I hear you.
FeralTee,💕 I'm sorry your plate is so full.. Cancer itself is overwhelming at times (most of the time when I allow myself to think about it!). Relationships often change because of cancer.. As does the need to focus on what the future might look like.. For everyone involved. Sending hopes for positive outcomes in both arenas. Losing a beloved pet on top of everything... Three summers we lost our beloved oversized fluff ball. We had a good long time with him but it's never easy to recover from loss. We have a new character in our lives.. He's middle aged and full of sweetness. I'm not sure what my future looks like but I know I couldn't face it without the unconditional love from a pet. Sending you wishes for best possible health and happiness! 💕
Defiant-Aerie-6862,"That is so much to have going on at once, I’m sorry. Sending hugs"
MyCarWasToad,"Sorry to hear, my NET got to my liver then I lost my deaf dog to a form of breast cancer- that broke me. Then this past December I lost my sister to ovarian cancer. I don’t know what it’s like going through a divorce so I can’t relate but I do know what it feels like to be hit with bad news back to back to back. I hope the spot on your liver is a benign cyst or something similar and that the counseling works out for the best."
Positive-Ad-6514,One moment at a time and focus on You.
Upbeat_Simple_2499,You're still kick ass-y! You're gonna need it to pull through this 😘
BusyBurdee,🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏sending you positive healing vibes
Comprehensive_Ad3589,You did it once. You can do it again - you’ve got a few good fights left in you. I read stories all the time of people beating back a recurrence. Wishing you all the best.
The_Cap_Lover,My first MRI of the liver was worse than my second. They gotta get the right dye in there. Fingers crossed you have a similar outcome. Liver spots often arent usually cancer to my knowledge.
CorporateNonperson,"Well, I'm trying to stay positive. That said, my Chromogranin A, a neuroendocrine marker, is 414. Normal is 90 and last year I was at 70. That combined with spot is pretty no bueno."
erinmarie777,"I know you don’t really want to discuss your marriage here, but I do feel shocked she actually said she didn’t care about your scan or your scan anxiety and then she had such a non-response to the news of the spot. That behavior suggests that she’s resentful about something that she hasn’t verbally expressed yet? I don’t know. I just hope she can look within herself and figure herself out and open up about why she wasn’t feeling empathetic to your emotions. You certainly deserve empathy and support. It’s so hard and so stressful to worry about it. Take a deep breath and tell yourself you will “wait and see”. Worry won’t help you, but I am so sorry you may have to beat back cancer again. I really hope they are wrong."
CorporateNonperson,"I'll admit that it wasn't a good look for her. She's realized it herself. She's planning on going to the MRI and oncology appointment with me. She's checking in with me about how I'm feeling it. She came over last night and we watched a movie and had dinner. Counseling sessions are ongoing. There were parts of the relationship where I wasn't pulling my weight. She's not great at communicating her needs, and so that builds resentment such that when she does communicate them it's not constructive. I told her this week that I needed to focus on this right now, so any effort to focus on us would have to start with her. I'll be there with her, but I only have so much capacity to freak out about something. And I really appreciate the effort that she is putting in. At the same time, I don't want to misread anything here. I don't know how much of this is her being my friend and how much of it is her wanting to give it another go, but right now I'll take anything I can get."
[deleted],She never cared. Leave her at the curb. You have better battles worth fighting for.
nzbluechicken,"You don't have to get through it well, just get through it. Keep taking one minute at a time, just keep breathing for the next minute. Then do one more. I had the same stage 4 and they told me I'd never make 5 years. That was 8 years ago. During the worst of treatment I'd watch the music channel and concentrate on surviving one song. Then one more song. You can do this. Don't be strong, be as miserable as you feel. But just keep breathing for one more song. [Hugs]"
inkrml,"36M stage 4 colon cancer. I was diagnosed in April and been on chemo since. It’s harsh, but you just gotta keep showing up. Have you ask for a change in your nausea meds? Alternating zofran and compazine might help get rid of some of that aspect for you. Wishing you the best and feel free to message me if you ever want to talk anything out."
Certifiedratkiller,I take zofran pretty much only when I take dilaudid because it makes me extra nauseous. I need to be more diligent about talking with my oncologist. I just sometimes feel like I’m at a loss for words when I’m speaking with my dr.
iSheree,If you don’t want to do anymore chemo. You don’t have to. ❤️
No_Cap_9561,Absolutely. It’s your choice.
Slow_Pair574,I pray these next round of chemo helps. I would eat ginger candies (trader joes). This helped with the nausea.
Educational_Web_764,"I am stage 4 esophageal too and have been doing treatments for it since February of 2023. What is your current chemo regime? As others have mentioned, I would see about meeting with palliative care as well and establishing a relationship with them. They help me with everything from pain management to insomnia to GI issues and they are amazing!"
AdTricky6194,I have constant nausea and throwing up as well. I feel the same way about chemo. I’m just tired. My support person keeps me going. So I would encourage you to lean on those that do that for you. You are stronger than you believe. You got this. It’s a hard fight but your life is worth fighting for !!!
National_Noise7829,"Anti nausea suppositories were so helpful for me! Maybe you could try that? I don't especially like putting things in my rear, but when I'm nauseated, it's better than trying to get a med down my throat."
Here-Comes-Mose,"Has anyone on a Palliative care team spoken to you about your symptoms? Please talk to your oncologist and hopefully they can have someone be closer to support you. They can be life savers to make things more bearable. I am sorry you have to experience this, but there are many options available to help you get through this."
Mobile-Egg9597,I’m sorry you got diagnosed with this!!! And so young too my husband was 36 when he was diagnosed at stage 4. It was in lymph nodes and his adrenals. Where has yours spread to? My husband is still here after 2.5 years but it’s getting tough in him now because he’s had lots of random complications. Bring up all your symptoms to your doc and care team to stay on top of it all and ask someone to help you too or come with to appointments!
CatO9Fails,42M stage 4 esophageal survivor here. I feel you and the crap you are going through. First up what have they got you on chemo wise and 2nd what antiemetics are you taking.
CatO9Fails,I was 38(2020) treatment was folfox chemo for 10 months then I had managed to kill it enough they did an Ivor Lewis esophagectomy on me. 4 years on and the only other complications has been the need for my gallbladder to be removed due to a massive gallstone and infection
True_Drummer_4383,"I know the struggle because my husband is currently going through his 6th cycle of FOLFOX for stage 4 esophageal cancer. Although I can't help with symptoms, I can maybe help change your perspective a bit. If you're getting another 6 rounds of this torture that means that the treatment is working for you which is great. My husband's cancer didn't respond to his first line of chemo. Now we're left with one less option. I'm very hopeful about this new drug combo but I can't pretend that I'm not disappointed. He suffered so much and cancer just grew in the meantime."
PartisansArmes,"Marijuana edibles can help a lot with nausea. I'v also found that ginger candies, aloe vera drinks along with coconut water, and carrot juice seem to help me a lot when I don't feel well."
PhilosophyExtra5855,I'm so sorry. That's a tough road you're walking. My words of hope: a friend recently celebrated 10 years NED after Stage IV esophageal cancer. I hope you can find some calm that helps you deal with the nausea and pain. Maybe others will have suggestions for anti-emetics?
OnlyTheGoodDieYun,I was diagnosed with stage 4 esophageal cancer in Feb. I know the outcome look is bleak. I tested and was able to do immunotherapy and targeted drugs. It’s been a game changer for me. I pray for a good outcome for you. I know it’s a struggle but you said you had a good support system. Well I’m here if you ever wanna talk. I get it trust me! I am just thankful for every day and been fighting super hard.
white_sabre,"Thiz reads like you're not pursuing anti-emitics heavily enough. Edibles, Compazine, Olanzapine, Dramamine, and Zofran can be selected individually or combined. You need to quell your nausea before you feel like staying in the fight. Compazine and Olanzapine worked wonders for me, whereas the most recent wonder drug, Zofran, didn't touch my nausea in the slightest. Good luck, and go kick your cancer in the ass."
Alternative_Dust3727,"I am 52 and have stage 4. In October I had my esophagus removed and bounced back quick. Did great for months. This May it came back, spread to my bones and lymph nodes. I’ve been on my second round of chemo for a few months now. I have a pump a bring home, does anyone have that? I feel ok, just tired and I throw up sometimes. I’m able to eat solids, but I have no appetite. I’m glad to see survivors here! We can beat this!!!"

Onewarmguy,My kidney cancer showed up again in my right lung TWICE! I'd been cancer free for 25 years.
Front-Ninja-6690,Thanks a ton!!!! Your post made my day!!!
Original-Mention-357,"I feared chemo as well but the first 6.5 cycles went smoothly. Last 1.5 not so much.. but what im trying to say is don't make yourself sick with fear and worry before you even begin. Enjoy the chemo free days when you can, eat well and try to gain some weight etc As for tips it depends on what chemo regime you're on."
tangerinedr3am_,"34F; Colon Cancer. I’m on my 2nd (local) recurrence since diagnosis in 2021. I had 5x rounds of palliative pelvic rads last month.. it’s inoperable unfortunately. I’ve started a medication called Stivarga, which only tries to maintain things. But my med onc is applying for Furquintinib. I’ve still got hope.."
Front-Ninja-6690,I'm in your corner. Thanks!
KittyKatHippogriff,"Depending on the pathology of your breast cancer, people are living with it more like a chronic disease. I have stage 4 and been stable about 1.5 years right now. There are tons of oral meds that can keep the cancer down. I do suggest to go to r/livingwithMBC"
Forgotmyusername8910,Sending you love and hoping for the best for you. 💜
SqueakyBall,"I just went through radiation for stage one breast cancer. The sessions themselves were short and painless for the first three and a half weeks. The last half week the radiation was still painless but the burns started to develop so it was uncomfortable. The next couple of weeks after treatment were uncomfortable, and a couple of months later I'm still very tired. That's not bad as far as cancer treatment goes. From what I've heard, radiation is toughest on people with head and neck cancers and on those with pelvic cancers. Breast cancer comes next because the area is so sensitive."
Faunas-bestie,"I did six rounds of the “red devil” doxorubicin and ifosfamide. My team well handled my nausea so it wasn’t a concern for me at all. Fatigue and low blood counts wiped me out, but I would always bounce back. Eat well and whatever you can tolerate. My taste’s temporarily changed where things I loved tasted awful, but novel things and food from my childhood were okay and my taste for my favorites returned at the end of each cycle. All my infusions were five days of hospitalization for each of my six rounds. I made sure I exercised and did laps around the halls every day. It’s very important to get up and walk around even when you don’t want to. It really helps. It’s not as bad as you think. Lots of people get through it and believe me, you’re as tough as they are."
Motherscooters,There are so many new treatments too. Targeted therapies that could really make a difference. You got this !!!!
tornac,"I‘m so sorry. This is my greatest fear. I know someone where it also came back after 10 years, she had to do chemo, but now is in remission again since five years. Don’t know about chemo, but radiation was not bad for me. Didn’t really feel it, just had something like a sunburn at the end."
Egoy,That sucks OP. It’s perfectly natural to fear chemo and radiation but if your fear is based on what you knew about them a decade ago things are better now than they were. I suggest a very honest discussion with your care team about your fears. Give them a chance to explain everything to you based on what patients are experiencing with your treatment plan today. It’s not pleasant (done them both myself) but there is a lot of things available to you that can help protect your health tissue and keep you safer and more comfortable during treatment. Best of luck OP.
SnooCookies1730,Ginger Gin Gin lozenges for nausea and Ensure type drinks for vitamins minerals and protein.
Perfect-Database-631,This is what I’m scared about and have a bit of anxiety as we age our immunity reduces and less support . I’m NED for 3+. Fully understand it’s beyond me. I’m 62
Nyc12331,"Don’t read statistics! I know it’s hard but just focus on what you have going on. Hydrate! Being hydrated makes the treatments less intense (for me anyways) I haven’t had any crazy symptoms except nausea and neuropathy. Try to be active, take a short walk everyday and keep stress to a minimum. I’m so sorry this is happening 💔"
Yourmomkeepscalling,"Chemo wasn’t so bad for me, it seems to have worked pretty well too."
500mlcheesemilk,"Radiation didn't hurt at all for me. I didn't feel anything at all, was just laying on the machine for a few minutes each day. Chemo is difficult. It does a lot of things to your body, like loss of hair. For me it wrecked my immune system and I was constantly sick with this and that. Otherwise I was fine, I didn't have nausea or fatigue."
Defiant-Aerie-6862,Sending hugs
nicolaann81,"My cancer has returned 3x, so basically 4x all together. It’s been nearly 4 years since my last diagnosis, which is the longest I’ve went. I was first diagnosed in 2015. I’ve had lots of treatments but I’m still going strong. You’ve got this, sending lots of positive thoughts and love your way 💗"
Poem_Upstairs,I am so sorry to hear this :( I’m on my third flavour of cancer… and still hopeful
ibakenaked,"I’m a frequent colon cancer flier. I’ve had 3 recurrences since 2019 at the confusion to all my Doctors as I wasn’t stage 4 at initial diagnosis. I just do chemo or have a surgery, and keep thriving. Haha"
Front-Ninja-6690,What an inspiring story. Thank you so much.
That-Gas-3183,"My uterine cancer came back after 8 years in remission. I was 23 the first go round and had stage 1. This time stage 4, and going through chemo and immunotherapy and debulking surgery. It's scary but my doctors are hopeful. Chemo takes a lot out of the body. At 31 I'm learning to give myself grace. Fatigue is high and I can't do much of what I wish I could, but there are good days between treatments, and I think keeping a positive support system of friends and family helps."
Front-Ninja-6690,I am cheering for you!!!
FrogAnToad,I had stage 3 breast cancer. After 25 years showed up everywhere in bones. Two years later still going. Had radiation and also ibrance and verzenio and anti-estrogens. Feeling ok now and the therapies are still holding. Courage!!!!
Front-Ninja-6690,Thank-you friend.
Clydesdale_climber,"After 3 years my liver cancer came back. Had major surgery and chemo both times. 9 months post surgery and 4 months off chemo now and no signs of it. It was tough but I tolerated it pretty well, stayed as active as I could, ate as well as I could , slept as well as I could, didn’t worry too much about things out of my control. Kept in touch with my social group. Started back at work part time while still on chemo (wanted to didht have to ) took some great vacations after chemo this summer. Be kind to yourself. Keep living life as best you can. Use all the support around you. Best wishes for you to get through it again!"
Front-Ninja-6690,You are so kind. Thank-you.
Top-Stuff-8393,get in touch with anadalou medical center and see if doctors there would be willing to try non chemo raditaion treatments. its a world class hospital and if its possible they would use measures that take 15 to 20 min and you might be on your way. though they will have to see your medical records to check if its possible or chemo is necessary. MRI guided radition therapy is also a better alternative as it has less side effects if necessary
Front-Ninja-6690,Thank-you for the advice. I live in Canada though. Don't know if I could be a patient there or if my treatment would be covered by our universal health plan.
gregshriv,My son finished chemo about 4 months ago. He said the worst part was the boredom of being in the hospital.
Nyc12331,"I can attest to this, bring stuff to do, OP!!"
Front-Ninja-6690,I have a low tolerance for boredom. Thanks for the tip.
MuffinTop4Ever,I’m working on recurrence #3 of TNBC. Have been on some kind of treatment for 5 years
Front-Ninja-6690,Best of luck!!!! Thanks for another injection of hope.
This-Army6223,I'm surprised with stage 2 that you didn't need chemo. I had chemo at stage 2a. I guess it depends on the grade. Anyway chemo for breast cancer is def doable. Keep on your anti nausea meds. Do you know who Lorna Luft is? Judy Garlands daughter. She's a singer in her 70s now. Well she had breast cancer and it came back in her ribs and a spot on her brain. She had surgery for both and treatment and they removed some of her ribs etc. My point is that she's back to doing concerts the past few years since that happened! And living a very full life. Often breast cancer can be lived with for a long long time. Take one day at a time. Don't fear chemo. Take one chemo at a time. Just keep focused on the day in front of you.
Front-Ninja-6690,Thank-you so much for the hope!
bitvampy,"My uterine cancer came back 10 years almost to the day this year. I just finished 6 rounds of chemo and 15 rounds of radiation. I was scared out of my mind. I did chemo 10 years ago and it really messed with my memory. This time has been difficult but I’ve leaned on family/friends and now I’m continuing with immunotherapy. This group and other cancer related ones really helped. So many people are going through similar issues and talking it out helps. It’s okay to be scared, it’s okay to ask for help. Try to take it one hour, day, decision at a time."
AnxiousDiva143,"I have breast cancer right now for the first time and recurrence is my biggest fear. When I first got diagnosed they told me it was early, was about 0.9 cm and didn’t show any lymph node involvement from biopsy/mri. Found out I had a genetic mutation with no history of cancer on either side of my family. Okay dmx. Surgery path showed a macromet of 7 mm. Okay radiation. My ki67 was high early on so it was aggressive. Oncoscore was 24 so now I’m doing chemo. I am receiving 4 dose dense AC treatments and 12 weekly taxol. I received my second dose of chemo today. The first round was rough not going to lie. Nausea was awful but before my second dose and even when I was at home I was communicating back and forth with the oncology nurse. I was able to mychart my questions or even call if I wanted and she would message back quickly or call back for further information. I got good premeds: steroids and two nausea meds: aloxi and emend. I had others on hand at home compazine and zofran for daytime bd olanzapaine at night. I was switched to phenergan to try and I also got some Reglan when I went to the ER for some shortness of breath ( it turned out to be nothing and may have been anxiety related). Some people say nausea is similar to heart burn so I also do Pepcid daily now or you can do protonix. I did get headaches from all the nausea meds I took. I did however not throw up once. I am now trying a sancuso patch this round to see if it helps. There are many options to manage your side effects. The best thing you can do is find an amazing medical oncologist and I promise you they will do everything they can to manage every single symptom you have. It is scary. My doctor told me I might have some anticipatory nausea this round so she gave me Ativan at the infusion. They will literally do everything to make you as comfortable as possible. You just have to tell them your symptoms and stay on top of them. Best of luck."
Front-Ninja-6690,Thank-you. My onco score was only 8 - 10 years ago. I didn't do chemo or radiation because the onco score was very low and I didn't have any lymph node spread. Just Tamoxifan was recommended for me for 5 yrs. I was soooo surprised it came back. Good luck. And thanks again!!!
Stargaza83,Can I ask what your original receptors were? I’m so sorry!
Front-Ninja-6690,"Thank-you. Sorry, what are receptors?"
lickykicky,"I'm sorry you have to bear this. Let me try and help you here. Your wife will sleep more and be less active, as you're seeing. Over time, she will eat less and less until she's down to only tiny amounts. Don't fight it; her body knows what to do. She may need support from hospice to manage any troublesome symptoms, but there's no reason for her to be uncomfortable in any way. She might stay in this phase for some time. At some point, her sleep will, in fact, be periods of unconsciousness. She won't know about this or feel she is 'slipping away'; from her point of view, she'll be awake or not, that's all. She will stop eating and drinking at all, and at this point, you're down to days. A good rule of thumb is the pace of change in her energy, eating, sleeping, and symptoms. The faster things are moving, the nearer to the end, so changes over weeks = weeks left and so on. She will eventually lose consciousness and not regain it. This isn't likely to be sudden, and the hospice people will have a good sense of whether it's imminent. Then it's a matter of doing whatever brings you and her the most comfort. There will be changes in her breathing and appearance over these last days and hours. These are normal and won't distress her - again, ask hospice for support. They know what they are looking for and will demystify the process in a sensitive way. If you feel able, maybe try to talk with your wife about these changes as she probably perceives the difference in herself. If you haven't already, have some frank and loving conversations now about what constitutes a good death for her, and stay close and connected for as long as possible. As a caregiver, remember to ask for support from others if you can. As long as your wife is safe, clean, and comfortable, you can take a step back when you need to. Caring for someone at the end of life is the most difficult thing you'll ever do, but it is a privilege and has the potential to be deeply healing for you both. I wish you all the love and connectedness now, and when you reach that sad yet transformational time. X"
Oldcoot58,Thank you for your reply. This is the kind of information I've been trying to get but no one seems to either know or are willing to give me the straight facts. Hospice has been good but somewhat of a cheerleader and unwilling to give me the level of detail you provided here. Hopefully your reply will help many caregivers in a similar situation. Bless you.
AngelsMessenger,Beautiful response. Well written too.
Some_Girl_Au,"Sorry you are going through this. My dad passed away 3 days ago from the same cancer with mets to bone and lungs. He lived for 5 months post diagnosis. It was really frustrating that no one would give me the information on what to expect. There was just the shock when things started to happen. When things changed, they changed really quickly. The nurses explained the mottling of the skin, usually in the extremities (grey and spotty with some pooling of blood where there has been pressure, so underside of legs, back, etc). Extremities go cold when they are close to passing. Make sure they bring mouth spray, mouth sponge swabs, and lip balm as when they stop drinking, you need to keep their lips tongue and top of mouth moist. And also moist wipes to keep their eyes clean. My dad had burst where he would sit up screaming and then go back to sleep. He had a lot of trauma in his life, so his last days were terrifying for him and us. Towards the end, he forgot all our names, and we were all called Miss, but occasionally, he would recognise us and smile or give us kisses. He started choking on solid foods in the last week, so he moved to puree and thickened liquid, he stopped eating first a couple of days after starting puree and then eventually drinking, he did like icy poles which is how we were able to get some fluids into him in the last couple of days. His breathing got really shallow and laboured, and they had to give him a medication to help with the sputum in the back of his throat as he did choke at one point. He would also stop breathing for long periods of time (like sleep apnoea) 30 seconds at a time. His breathing just got shorter and shorter, but it wasn't laboured anymore. It was just little breaths that got smaller and smaller until he passed. We played his favourite music, held his hands, talked to him, re lived happy moments, and had jokes and laughs with him right up till the end."
PoopyMcDoodypants,You're a good husband 🫂
danijay637,"Truly sorry you are going through this. Do you have a good support system in place? How are you sleeping and eating? I strongly recommend you take breaks, however small, to keep your mind and body calm during this time. Caregivers can burnout. I know you want to giver her the best care until they end but I’m sure she wants you to not be overly anxious."
Oldcoot58,"Yes, I have a pretty good support system. My son and his family have been coming every other week which is a 4-hour drive each way. My brother and his wife have made a few visits too. I have a few local folks that check in on a regular basis as well. Sleeping...not good since my wife is having sleep issues as well. We've moved her to the first floor in our family room so we didn't have to deal with stairs. She sleeps in her hospice hospital bed and I sleep on the couch about 10 feet away so I can help her during the night. It's been this way for 7 months. I haven't gotten burnout yet but I can see how it happens. I just try to occupy my time while she's sleeping with books, television, projects around the house, etc. The Olympics was a great diversion. I probably watched at least one competition in every sport during that time! Thanks for asking."
colbsk1,"First, I want to express how deeply sorry I am for what you and your wife are going through. She is incredibly fortunate to have your support during this time. What you're experiencing reminds me of the last 77 days of my mother's life. She was diagnosed with small cell carcinoma in May of 2024 and passed away on August 10th 2024. Her cancer was extremely aggressive, partly due to her heavy smoking and drinking. Despite the installation of a chemo port, she chose not to undergo chemotherapy, opting instead to avoid the side effects and spend her remaining days with some semblance of quality. In her final days: On August 8th, around 2:30 p.m., my mother decided to lie down for a nap. That was the last time she got out of bed. She was still eating, talking, and using the bathroom, but as the week progressed, she ate less, spoke less, and slept more. On August 10th, her final day, my dad reported that at 1:30 a.m., my mom woke him by hitting him and said, ""Let's go."" When he asked where, she didn’t respond, and they both went back to sleep. It seemed to me that this was a brief burst of energy before her final moments. In her last hours: At 4:30 a.m. on August 10th, my dad was awakened by labored breathing followed by the death rattle. By 6:45 a.m., she was grinding her teeth, a sign of possible pain, so she was given morphine. Her eyes were half-open, without movement, and her pupils were unresponsive to light. When I arrived around 10:15 a.m., she appeared lifeless, though her chest still rose and fell weakly. The sound of mucus and saliva with her shallow breaths was unsettling. Her legs were purple, her feet moved sporadically, and her eyes were glassy. I tried to get a response by making eye contact, squeezing her hand, and tickling her feet, but there was no reaction. I did manage to get a slight groan when I massaged her shoulder. Holding her hand, it grew cold rapidly. I left briefly to speak with my dad, and upon returning, I found her chest no longer moving and the rattling sound had stopped. It was clear that she had passed away. The time was 3:15p.m., the same time I was born oddly enough. I hope sharing this helps in some way. If not, that's okay too. Writing about it has been a form of solace for me, as I don’t keep a diary or journal. Keep fighting, and know that my thoughts are with you and your wife. Edit: Fuck cancer!!!"
EdC1101,"It’s had to recognize, but you are deep into the Grief process. All your attention is to your wife, as is expected. From your description, I would think she is in later stages. I lost my wife to Alzheimer’s. I too was primary caregiver. I postponed and delayed self-care. That was not a good sacrifice for my own survival and health. Stress is not good for personal health. Stomach cancer surgery & later prostate cancer radiation after that… Serious dental issues…. With that experience, take care of yourself now. Get your personal healthcare up to date. Comprehensive Physical Check with Doctor; aches, labs, tests, ect. Dental visits, Eyes checked, shoes & mobility."
iSheree,I am so sorry about your wife. You are doing very well and you are doing what a husband should be doing and thats taking care of your wife. Take care of yourself also. I don’t have a clue how long the dying process takes so I can’t help you there. It varies like you said. But I just wanted to recommend Hospice Nurse Julie on Youtube. She is great and many people wish they saw her videos before their loved ones passed away.
Stormy261,"I'm so sorry. My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 HCC and a DVT that was inoperable. He lived for 9 months after diagnosis, and that was longer than we originally thought. He had to get pericentesis every other week for most of that time, and towards the end, he wasn't physically able to make the trip. Most treatments gave him an adverse side effect, so he went off all treatments within a few months. With him, it was noticeable once the pain levels started increasing and the appetite severely decreased. He lost significant weight towards the end. Boost Breeze was his favorite supplement, and he started drinking them for each meal instead of once daily. He would take a few bites of food at a time, and toddler servings were the most I would give him per meal. When he had a craving for something, I did everything in my power to fulfill it. Reach out to your cancer center to see if you can get free supplements if you haven't already."
Soft_Welcome_5621,❤️
JohnnySacks63,Sorry this is happening. Wishing you and your wife all the best.
Reasonable_Joke6761,"I’m sorry you’re going through this, it’s very tough. I’m a nursing student and have had many palliative patients, and i recently myself experienced it with my grandmother, where i held her hand until the last breath. Experiencing someone die can be very scary and strange the first time, just remember that this is completely normal and that you might be confused or shocked the first time - if you haven’t experienced it before, that is. Like many others have said, sleeping and eating are the primary signs of death approaching. She will start to eat less and less, until she completely stops eating. With this, she will begin to sleep more and you might be unable to wake her up at times. During these phases you can apply some water to a piece of cloth and wet the inside of her mouth - since the mouth can become very dry. I highly recommend you to ask the hospice for support and advice, this will make it easier for you. When you are very close to approaching death, her extremeties might become cold and blue/pale, and her skin on her face will sink in, and her breathing will gradually become slower, until it eventually stops. The best you can do is to keep her comfortable."
naughtymortician,"Hang in there, you are doing your best OP. Wishing you all the best. Hug's. ❤️❤️"
Oldcoot58,"All: I won't be able to respond to each of you individually but I just wanted to say how humbled I am with everyone's compassion and genuine concern with my situation. I know we all deal with our own life challenges each day and for you to take the time to wish the best for my wife and me, share your experiences and offer some sage advice gives me hope that the world can become a better place to live, raise a family, and grow old gracefully. This was the first time I've posted to Reddit and it was more out of frustration that I couldn't get the straight answers anywhere else that I got here in this forum. You're good people and I will do my part to pay it forward. Thank you again."
Majestic-Ladder1447,"My mom was diagnosed with liver cancer in January. I’m 19 - So it’s been rough. She just got surgery this morning at Dartmouth Hospital to try and help, but I don’t think there will be any help. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Liver cancer, and any cancer at all is a horrific disease and it’s so so hard to see them go through it. Sending you and your wife all of the positive and healing energy you need ❤️❤️❤️"
acidmushroom77,I'm so sorry. I'm sorry I don't have any advice even though I might face this situation some day (hopefully not soon). I just want to send you both a virtual hug.
kelly90260,My wife was diagnosed with metastatic Melonma in her liver on May 30 on June 24 She went into complete renal failure and she passed away on June 30 it was so quick we had only seen the oncologist only once
Littleshuswap,Could he be allergic to the Tegaderm Bandage? I'd take him back to the Doctors. Congratulations on your son beating cancer!!
cancerkidette,I think this must be an allergic reaction to the bandage - I had plenty to certain types of adhesive and I can’t imagine how much more sensitive a little baby’s skin would be! Poor thing. I’d take him in to be seen and have a derm consult. They’ll probably give him a bit of steroid to calm things down.
Icy-Surprise-2610,I bet it's the bandage. I am allergic to the adhesive on most bandages. I developed blisters within minutes. They can get special tape etc for such allergies. You also have to be careful and ensure they don't use the wrong tape rtc. I can't tell you how many times they try and use the standard tapes etc on me even though on my chart at the cancer clinic that I am allergic.Congratulations on your Son being cancer free! Awesome News!
Luella254,"I’ve had allergic reaction to bandages as well as to chlorahexadine, which they use to clean the skin before giving shots or doing surgery. The rash grows and grows. I treated it with prescription cream from the doctor."
DunkingTea,"So sorry you’re going through this. I don’t have any specific answers, but seriously push to see a different oncologist if yours is not giving you treatment options or info."
dsilvester,The last thing she said is we've done surgery and radiotherapy and what I took from that is there's nothing else we can do. I'd be happy with radiotherapy too kinda numb the pain a bit but I dunno if that's an option as she gave me a course of 10 days before my surgery and a single 1 day dose 7 months ago. I was hoping for another 1 day dose but I'm scared if it becomes even more unbearable she'll come out with there's nothing more we can do and stop my medications
FeralTee,"I'm very sorry to hear your news. I am not terribly enlightened with everything regarding cancer, even my own cancer.. Though I research quite a bit! I hope there is someone with some answers for you! Sending warm thoughts and wishes for best possible health and happiness! 💕"
doofdoofies,"I know you will probably hear this a lot, but I'm so sorry you are going through this. Is it just pain management you are seeking?"
dsilvester,Pain management and a possibility or option to stop the met in its tracks.
hou91,"I'm so sorry for you, I hope other rounds of radiotherapy are still an option for you. i don't know if this useful or not, ever patients are different & every cancer is different & protocols change from country to another. I had bone metastasis from a breast cancer and in addition of chemo they gave me 30 perfusion over 3 years of Biphosphanate, it helped with my pain as the type of metastasis that i had was osteolytic type of lesion. (osteolytic type when tumor cells break down the bone while there's osteoblastic where the bone became sclerotic or the mixed type with the two types of lesions)"
dsilvester,I'm having biophosphonates but the pain is hurting
SDamon83,"You can have radiation again to your spine. May want to find another oncologist, who will take your needs seriously. Good luck and I’m sorry you’re in so much pain. You really shouldn’t be with all the treatments they have for your bone Metastasis. You have to be your own vocal health Advocate with a strong voice to get your pain under control. 🙏🏻"
iSheree,"I wonder if the treatment can still be done for quality of life purposes, even if it won't cure you. If your oncologist doesn't seem to care, then I think you need to find a new one if possible. I know it's not possible for some. I haven't got a choice in which specialists I see but I feel this is worth mentioning."
PetalumaDr,I don' know the rules in England but you should have the right to speak with your Radiation Oncologist and get their expert opinion on whether you are done with radiation or not. Agree with pain specialist if Oncologist not adequately addressing the pain. Good luck.
feathernose,"I’m so sorry.. i went through excruciating pain from tumors in my spine too, it’s the worst pain i’ve ever felt and also felt i couldn’t live long with that kind of pain. Is it possible for you to find another oncologist? Second time radiation is sometimes possible, as well as another chemo, and surgery. It took me 3 surgeries (because it grew back) and maybe more in the future. There have to be doctors willing to look out of the box and willing to help you. There are also medications for these kinds of pain. Your doctors should really be more helpful. Please stand up for yourself and do everything you can! Sometimes doctors need a reality check. It took me initially years before my GP took my pain seriously. They were almost too late. Please look out for yourself. And seek for help <3 maybe all hope is not lost."
Maine26,"My mum was told the only option she had was chemotherapy for her metastatic breast cancer recently, and we ended up booking a second opinion appointment at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London. They were absolutely brilliant, and told us about two other medications my mum can have on the NHS, she started taking one of these this week. I'd really recommend getting a second opinion elsewhere if you can - I'm not sure where you are based, but the Royal Marsden is apparently a world renowned hospital for cancer patients, so might be worth taking a look :) Really hope you manage to find a good treatment for you."
dsilvester,Ps. I had radiotherapy 7 months ago. I don't know if I'm allowed anymore but if I'm not I'm pretty much dead. my advice??
Cookielipz49,"Pain mgt Dr. is a start. Do you have your case in order? Records, scans etc? If not, assemble it from existing medical team. This way you can present your case to other Drs/Oncologists. Try Mayo clinic, or, Sloan, or MD Anderson. Don’t stay still. I’ve been rowing this boat for a bit over two years now. Barely surviving, surviving and staying positive just the same"
This-Army6223,I had palliative radiation to my hip even though I already had pelvic radiation. A good radiation oncologist will assess how much radiation you've had to an area and see if they can give you a couple doses more. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. Bone mets suck. Mine absolutely throbbed. The radiation did help.
TimelyCaterpillar538,Not sure if it's allowed but I'm planning to try the Jane McLelland Off Label Drugs method. At the end what have you got to loose?
EvieSilver,Have they offered Xgeva?
dsilvester,"No, I have another drug similar to that I think. It's called zometa"
Slafkovsky,Chordoma here. Sorry you're going through this. Has anyone discussed proton beam therapy with you?
dsilvester,I just enquired and got an email back today stating it's for primary tumours not mets
no-user-names-,"Hello. I’m UK also. I’m guessing you’ll have been down this route, but have you contacted the Macmillan helpline? 08088080000 They are amazing. If you have an oncologist you can’t communicate with / you feel blocked by etc you can get fantastic information from them and loads of options to ask for that you might not have been offered. Or travel to one of the Maggies Centres who are also amazing. https://www.maggies.org/ Obviously you want to stop the cancer, but have you been referred to palliative care for pain control? They’re amazing too - it doesn’t mean they have given up on treating you - but they may offer far more creative options than the oncologist. Big hugs. I’m so sorry you’re going through this."
dsilvester,Thank you I will contact them
ReadingNo728,"Start looking for a new oncologist. Are you by any of those Cancer Treatment Centers of America or Roswell Park?? If so, look into that. Then, just as added support, maybe see a holistic doctor."
Engman1,I’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. I too have metastatic bone cancer from my thyroid. Prayers you you
dsilvester,Prayer for you too. How are you coping? Where are they and are they doing anything for it?
tshawkins,"I have a simular condition, i have just been for a PET-CT Scan to determine if there is a single or multiple mylenoma tumor. that im told is to determine if i need chemo or radiation treatment. Im in Bangkok in thailand, and still working. We have very good theatment options here and the prices are afordable. Im very worried at this point, i dont know what lies ahead, or what my probabilities are. They found the tumor looking for the cause of increasing painfull sciatica. Its useualy caused by a herniated disc, but im my case it was a spinal bone lesion. Im told they are slow growing, about 5% per year."
EileenForBlue,"Please see a pain specialist! You need a pain specialist. Tell your oncologist you need a referral to a pain specialist! Also, believe it or not Claritin helps bone pain. I take one daily. If your oncologist doesn’t get you a referral you definitely need a new one. I just had to change my oncologist 2 months ago and I’m so glad I did. If yours won’t listen, you need a new one!"
Quick-Employment-229,"I think Claritin is used to treat the bone pain that arises from an overproduction of histamines, which are by-products that are produced along with WBCs in the marrow, which is triggered by the neulasta/Pegfilgrastim shot that many of us take. What OP is describing here is pain caused by bone cancer. How can Claritin help with that?"
Educational_Key1206,I don’t know the answer to your question. But my heart goes out to you. I am very sorry for all you are going through right now. Sending you good thoughts. 💞
FamousVeterinarian00,"Thank you, you are so kind. ☺️"
FatLilah,"People don't know what to say. We endure so much and somehow keep going. I am sorry for what you and your son are facing, it must be so scary and overwhelming. Your feelings are valid and you deserve for them to be heard and acknowledged. I am wishing you love and strength to face what is ahead."
FamousVeterinarian00,"Thank you, you are so kind. I know people don't know what to say, I don't blame them. My emotions are just not good. My eyes are puffy from crying and everything feels so heavy."
Down_The_Witch_Elm,"""Everything is going to be okay,"" is probably said by people who mean well, but it's really pretty dismissive. I think a lot of people just don't know what to say in situations like this. I would just say treasure the time you have together and get the most out of each day. No matter how things go, you won't have any regrets that way. Wishing you and your family all the best."
Aware-Marketing9946,"We say that in the hopes that everything will be ok. What should you do now? I can only surmise what I would do in your case. Your son is old enough to decide what he wants. As a mother I would look for treatment, and to love and support my son. Platitudes aren't helpful. I will pray on your behalf, for your boy, and offer an ear if you ever need it."
FamousVeterinarian00,"We had a very serious conversation a few days ago, he expressed that he's too tired now and realized that he have no good quality of life. He wouldn't be better. He wants to stop. We offered him to talk to his therapist about his thought, he did last Friday. He said sorry if he makes us sad with his thoughts. I don't want him to feel a pressure to keep going because of us. I told him that. Thank you. I'll tell him and let him decide. Thank you for your prayers. It means a lot to us."
nowaymary,"""it will all be ok in the end. If it's not ok then it's not the end"" I was told this by a smug person who would never get cancer because she doesn't drink alcohol It's a particularly dumb platitude because in my case the end involves me dying from this. It makes my teeth itch with the urge to kill someone if this is said to me I think it can be said trying to be comforting. I don't find it remotely comforting, no no no no no"
StrangeJournalist7,"At 14, having dealt with illness all of his remembered life, I would guess that your son has an old soul. He knows what he wants. If he is already thinking about stopping treatments, I would imagine the newest leukemia diagnosis will make him even more sure. I'm so sorry for you and the rest of your family. Will it be OK? No, but there's no choice in whether or not it is OK. Horrible situation. May your son's days be peaceful, and may he have more good days than bad ones going forth."
mrshatnertoyou,"It is something to say when there is nothing to say. Cancer is about day to day and not worrying about the future. Deal with today what you are supposed to do and what you know. Thinking ahead and trying to figure out what will happen will only drive you crazy with worry. Live in the moment and enjoy the small things, a conversation or breakfast. What matters is what happens in between and enjoying those moments and building what ever positive memories you can during that time."
sPaRkLeWeAsEL5,"It’s never a guarantee anything will be ok for anybody. We have no idea which day, month,hour, minute, or second will be our last. Most people live with the mentality of “that won’t happen to me.” It is so unfair what is happening to your son, but life is so unpredictable. He may live to be 100. Severe injuries and illnesses seem to catapult us back into the reality of our mortality, but we are all mortal."
oneshoesally,"Nothing about cancer is ever ok. Never. People who say this either haven’t been affected by it (yet) or are in denial. I’m NED and it’s not ok and I never will be. I’ve just accepted day to day life and ignore those types of comments and thoughts. I’m never going to be ok after all this, I’m not the same, if I die, my loved ones would never be ok. It’s okay to NOT be okay. We are what we are for however long we are here."
TheTapeDeck,"No one can really know. His take is important. His consent is based partially on how he feels, but should also be based on what the docs think they can or can’t accomplish. It’s worth a lot of suffering if you can get to the other side of that and heal and have some real years of normalcy. But the sliding scale between that and the worst stuff is really his to operate, IMO. Thinking of you guys."
Nkengaroo,"I don't believe everything is going to be okay, because sometimes it isn't. Okay is so subjective, what's okay to one person is not to another person. What I do believe is, everything works out, even if it's not the way we want it to. Our loved ones get sick, but we find our inner strength to help them. Sometimes they die, and we find the inner strength to go on. Sometimes we get so fucking tired of it all, but we find the strength to rest for a while, to gain the strength to keep going. And along the way, we keep finding small and large joys in life. And we find happiness again, eventually. It works out, eventually."
chellychelle711,"For me, even when I tell my loved ones about my constant issues and diagnoses I say it will be ok. Because for me, it means that whatever decision or event happens it just is. I have no control outside of my decisions and this horrible rare genetic disease with no cure, my post stem cell transplant issues and my other diagnoses which do not have cures, are part of my circle of life (not to be cheesy). The end will come when it’s time. And then peace. Time continues on, the world keeps spinning but after losing my mom and my BFF both to cancer I know this to be true - it will be ok. The sun will set on that day and will rise to start anew for those who continue on. Sending love to your family 💜"
_Synthetic_Emotions_,Lie. Cancer or no cancer everyone and everything will die in the end. Everything goes from a state of order to a state of chaos. The moment you're born you begin to die. People who say other wise are delusional and fooling themselves.
patatonix,"People don't know what to say and this can be a pain for anyone not wanting to be lied to. I will humbly share what did help me sometimes with uncertainty: we don't know what's going to happen, but whatever comes we will face it together. You and your son, and whoever may accompany you, are able to share whatever comes in your way. In this world, we may share a room or a neighbourhood with people we couldn't care less about. There are no guarantees about having someone to share the burden. You have yourselves and are determined to face the outcome. If you are able to find some solace in that, take it. Like you said, you have been dealing with this ordeal for so long now, and yet I'm sure along with all the pain you managed to make some good memories. Many parents would say in spite of it all they feel lucky to have known their sons. And if this feels like shitty to no consolation, that's perfectly fine as well. If I were to receive these catastrophic news, the pain would be unbearable, but I would like to hear something like that. You are together in this. Praying for you. Here to talk if you need to."
Warthog__,"I'm a cancer patient for Plamablastic Lymphoma, a rare and aggressive cancer. No one should ever say that to you, because they cannot know that. Honestly, it may not be OK. And it is ""OK not to be OK"". Cancer sucks, disease sucks, it is horrible, and the reality is that only your doctors will be able to give you any truth. And even then all they can give you is a probability--essentially a dice roll. There are no guarantees. That's the truth of it. People's hearts are in the right place. We are taught empathy and to try to make people feel better and lift them up and give them hope. We aren't taught how to talk about cancer in a healthy way. Honestly, some of it is because so much of this stuff is new. It used to be you got cancer and you died. The whole surviving and treatment thing is relatively new. I cannot imagine what it is like for you as a parent. As much as it sucks for me, I'd rather be dealing with it myself a million times over than have my child deal with it. Going back to the dice roll analogy. Every roll of the dice with cancer treatment costs something. And not talking about money. The toll it takes on your body and mind is unimaginably hard--chemo, radiation, surgery. I think every cancer patient should have that conversation with their doctor on what they are buying. I went through a year of hell for a 60% chance of being NED. That was a bet I was willing to make. Now if they told me it was a year of hell for a 1% chance, I might have thought differently."
featherblackjack,"Love your son as best you can. He's not his cancer, even though it sure can seem like it. It helps to love him and disregard, even for a few hours or even minutes, that he's so very ill. Go for walks, read to him, let him tell you about Pokemon, whatever he likes. Be as close as you can be with him. Take everything day by day. Big hugs from an internet stranger who has some idea of what you're going through."
madlyeverafter,"All I can say is let him do what he wants. He may get through it or may not. Whatever happens it’s not going to be okay, no amount of platitudes will ever help. 💚"
Flashy-Pomegranate96,"Consult with your child’s medical oncology team, but, in general the long term survival for children with AML is 60-70%, with some cases approaching 90%. So while it is a tough break his survival chances are good."
[deleted],"AML and secondary AML (arising from other bone marrow disorder or caused by treatments for other Cancer) have different outcome and survival rate. The outcome for secondary AML said to be not-so-good. And also OP's son already diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma. Reading from OP's post history, it is sure that OP's son is having a hard time regarding his health and been dealing with a bunch of medical issues. I can only imagine how hard it is. But I agree they should discuss with their son's medical team."
partofbreakfast,"I think people say it because it's what we say to people going through tough times. Like, yeah, right now sucks a lot. But a low point now doesn't mean everything will suck forever. Things will be better someday. Not everyone responds well to that though, and especially when it's cancer it's a bad thing to say unless you really, really know that the person in question finds comfort in those words. But I think people just don't know what to say besides stuff like that. ""I'm sorry"" and ""fuck cancer"" and stuff like that. For me, I find comfort in ""everything is going to be okay"" while I absolutely hate ""fuck cancer"". Everyone has different feelings about it though."
iSheree,"I am a cancer patient and I always say everything is going to be okay. I am not offended when other people say it because their intentions are good. The truth is, even in death, everything will be okay. Death is a part of life and I believe there is more... As long as I have a roof over my head and I am safe, I am okay... It's my way of coping. I have suffered my whole life."
AnxiousDiva143,I’m so so sorry for you and your family. I can’t imagine everything your poor little boy has had to endure. The fact that you’re even asking if everything is going to be okay still just shows how positive of a person you are. I think you’re the only one that can really answer that question for yourself. I know it’s hard but please stay strong for your boy. You are such a wonderful caring loving mother and your son is so lucky to have you in his life. 🤗
Pyrheart,"The only people I trust and believe them when they say it are my husband, my mom and my onc. Everyone else it’s just an annoying platitude that would end the conversation and be a red flag not to talk to them anymore about anything not superficial. I’m sorry for your hardships. I have friends with disabled children and all I can offer is, support groups with other parents have been helpful for them."
ihateorangejuice,"I also have the tp53 mutation, it’s called LI–fraumeni syndrome I believe. I know it’s as terrible mutation, and often causes childhood cancers that are aggressive. I haven’t met anyone else with this mutation. I have stage 4 breast cancer for mine. I believe he will have to do scans for the rest of his life, but the good news is that he is already known to have it and they can hopefully fend off other cancers as they come. I’m so, so sorry. The good news is that they know, and hopefully that will help them fight it differently because there is much more research now for this mutation. I was NED until just recently, I sincerely and pray that the same will happen with you."
BrokenHopelessFight,It’s neither
wm_ghostcat,"I am sorry- he should get to live life more. I am sorry but I do not peddle hope. Though despair won't bring you much either. In all honesty, from personal experience, I thought it would mean something of significance to hear that ""It's gonna be okay"" but I've found it eerie to hear aloud. My brain says, ""You don't know if everything is gonna be okay. I might be afraid of not having hope but I am afraid of failing hope."" My grandma passed away a couple years back and I knew I wasn't going to see her on her last day so we were on a video call and she goes (like old people do sometimes), ""I want to die. I am ready to go"". The thing is that I knew in that instance she did not want me to say ""don't say that"". All I said was ""It's gonna be okay. You can rest now. We'll be okay"". She passed away 36ish hours later. If he's anything like me, he loves you and he knows you love him despite whatever has been his life. But say it aloud and often to let him know. That's sweeter to hear and you won't come to regret not telling him that often. I don't know you but I am a decade older than your son and whenever I got sick and would avoid contact to rest and recover- my mother would make her worry induced my sickness a burden for me to bear. I get a parent be worried sick about their child regarding whatever the child is going through but that's not on the child to carry. So make sure that you spend time with him, make sure he's happy, and for what it's worth- resolve those issues (he too is worrying that he's sick and he's worrying about what it's doing to you. I might be projecting a little)"
PetalumaDr,"I'm sorry this is happening to you. I have no wisdom or pithy comments for you, just compassion for your circumstances. Good luck."
erinmarie777,"I think saying “everything will be okay” is something that can feel comforting at times even when it’s probably not true. I’m so sorry for your son and you and your family. Maybe because your son was already thinking about stopping treatment, in some ways, he will take this as his permission to just enjoy the rest of his life as long as he can. Idk. It’s so hard for me to know what to say to you. I’m just very sorry that you have been given such bad news and have to tell him this awful news."
PartisansArmes,"People say it because they don't have anything else to say. It's more of someone being unsure how to process so people speak in cliches when that happens. The problem for everyone is the question of how much trauma/pain can someone handle and is fighting becoming so exahustive that the person's quality of live is terrible. What I will say is that being in a study could help him and it could also help others and that might be the biggest thing out of all of this. Everyone of us are part of record to help others who may face the same things we are facing. Certainly we'd like to be the miracle story, but if we can't but we can help someone else I'd say that is worth a whole lot."
TheBrothersBellic,I think it's a thing people say to be hopeful. But I truly believe that death is indeed a feather bed and that all will indeed be ok in the end.
Illustrious_Dog_4182,"The Hindu sage, Ramana Maharshi contracted cancer. He always had a smile on his face and never complained or gave any indication of discomfort as his body condition became worse and worse. I am just offering food for thought."
Mundane_Sky_1994,“Thanks I’ll ask my oncologist!” Is one route. “I heard it causes uncontrollable diarrhea!” Is another.
QuestoPresto,This was absolutely the best route for me. “Thanks so much for caring enough to research. I’ll ask my medical team” I never once had anybody come back and ask if I did any of the suggestions.
sleddingdeer,"Be direct. “Aunt, I know you mean well, but you must stop suggesting treatment options to me. I am comfortable with my medical team and you are inadvertently hurting me and stressing me out. I know that you love me and that is unintentional, but I need you to hear me when I tell you to stop.” She will feel bad and may get defensive, but do not engage any further. Just say, I have told you how I feel and that’s not going to change. If she persists, leave, end the conversation. Every single time."
tornac,"This is so infuriating. I had people trying to convince me about trying healing crystals or apple vinegar. Yes, apparently apple vinegar cures every cancer 🙄.I know they want to help but they are so clueless and obnoxious, it makes me mad."

wisteria_town,"Being direct and telling her you do not need any treatment suggestions is one way, but I found that it doesn't help. Honestly. People think they know best and you cannot shake that. You can argue with them until you're blue in the face & they'll still come out of it thinking ""Well I know best and I want what's best for (OP) why don't they accept my help!!"". I've had this encounter a hundred times over, literally just today too. I've stopped arguing & just retreat nowadays. A personal experience would be when a lady whose daughter has soft tissue cancer iirc was talking my ear off about going vegan, cutting sugar out, ""natural remedies"" all of that bullshit. She literally told me ""Well get on eating!!"" with a snarky tone (when she heard my CBC was low) & when I explained I've a bunch of restrictions that don't allow me to eat a variety of food (neutropenic diet & precautions that have been working wonders for me, not a single infection so far) she said I ""trust my doctors too much"". Thanks boo, I'll keep trusting them, I don't feel like dying yet. I know she's your aunt & you don't want to hurt her feelings but don't let her hurt yours. I'm sure she wants what's best for you but boundaries have to be established. This well I know the secret remedy! stuff is dangerous behavior IMO because while you might not fall for it, others will. See the lady above. Best of luck & health OP 🤍🤍🤍"
danijay637,"You can try but some People really can’t help themselves . They don’t want anyone to trust modern medicine. And listen , I don’t believe my doctors knows everything but they definitely know each cancer is different. And that’s something the people who make suggestions to ‘help’ don’t seem to know. So whenever someone says “have I tried XYZ yet?” I’ll say oh have you found it works for stage 4 breast cancer that’s HER2+ with Mets to the brain and liver AND for my secondary uterine cancer ? Oh your treatment works for ALL of the hundreds of types of cancers in existence . Got it.”"
chellychelle711,"I just shutdown any communication with that person. By saying I’ll check with my doctor, she might be thinking she’s got the in. My family is ridiculous and I had to ignore whatever communication and let my dad know his brother or SIL is out of bounds and tell her to knock it off. This was specifically my aunt. I’ve had some of my very best friends suggest crap like alkaline water and I just stopped communicating. These are the same ones who don’t care that I need everyone around me vaccinated and not at risk to give me something while I’m immunocompromised. They think well they don’t mean me because I’m related or close and disregard. I still don’t have the desire to put any energy into anyone who’s doing this crap. You only have so much a day and there are better things to spend it on especially just doing for yourself. It’s just noise and you don’t have to be nice and courteous all the time just because you love them. It sounds rough but boundaries are super important. If needed an onc psychiatrist or therapist is also a great neutral ear to help you deal and get through this. Best wishes"
Holiday-Book6635,Thank you. I’m following the advice of my medical team. I’ll check on that with them.
This-Army6223,"Honestly you can't. You just need to keep telling them every cancer is different and your care team knows what kind yours is, etc. It is maddening I know. I recently stopped treatment because nothing is working and I have a friend who insisted that there was a kind of chemo that has zero side effects and it kills everything cancer. It's like yeah I think that if that was available to me it would be available to me. Kept insisting that I asked my doctor so I finally did just to shut her up and no it's not an option and yes it has a ton of side effects. People see or hear one thing online or they see some kind of TV commercial or something and they think they have the answer. It really makes everything about cancer even harder when you have people coming at you from all sides with all sorts of "" cures"" some of the medical and some of them are not. There was a woman at church who constantly approaches me and I finally just keep telling her no. No, no more. I think she finally got the clue this last time. The hard thing is that these people mean well and they want to see you well. But they have no idea that it's very taxing to hear this kind of thing coming at you from all directions."
AdventurousSleep5461,"""Thanks, but I'm going to listen to my oncologists on this. They went to medical school to learn about treating cancer and have been practicing and actually treating cancer patients for x years."" And if they continue after that I'd stop answering their calls/texts/messages. I don't have the bandwidth to be polite anymore, so ignoring inappropriate behavior is all I can manage that won't cause more issues."
jw071,"EVERYONE IS AN EXPERT. I was finally able to terminate my relationship with my oncologist this year and you know even my mother thinks I got over cancer along time ago, even though I’ll never regrow those body parts or get over the damage done by chemo people still know better than me five years later."

vastlyshallow,"Thanks everyone for all the great advice! I know she means well but it borders on abuse when I'm just too tired to fight. I think an ultimatum is necessary and let the cards fall where they may. I need peace and I can't accept anything else. Thanks again, y'all are super!"
erinmarie777,"If you don’t want to hurt her feelings, you can say you will look at it later, but right now what you need most from her is to please talk about anything else to distract you because you need a break. Then change the subject by asking about her family, her activities, her feelings, etc. Hopefully she will want to support you by respecting your needs."
Valuable_Process_299,"I have only taken advice from other people that have had or have cancer. Well, plus my oncologist too."
wobgon,"You can’t. It’s about their own fear. Just say thank you, and tell them you’ll look into it. They mean well but they are scared. Your recent diagnosis is an alarm, reminding them that they will one day die."
Head-Place1798,"""Cool! I'll give you some of my cancer and we can both try it together."" Repeat ad nauseam. Even more effective if you can without a syringe from your bag. Ask one of the nurses for a 10 CC sterile saline syringe for extra effect. I swear they will love it. This person does not respect you or your struggle or medicine. Endeavor to make them as uncomfortable as you can. Let them sit with the idea that they could be sick as well. They may be well meaning so perhaps you should give them one free comment."
nuance61,"I liked this from QuestoPresto below: “Thanks so much for caring enough to research. I’ll ask my medical team” . If that approach doesn't work, move on with telling her that if any of the alternatives actually worked, nobody would even need chemo. If she persists, tell her you will NOT discuss this with her again. Some people just need to be told."
feathernose,"Oh is it like ‘eat a dozen of apricot seeds a day’ or ‘take a vitamin C overdose daily’? If yes, are we family?"

AuntyMeme,"Sadly, the ""standard of care"" treatments don't have the best outcomes."
aligpnw,"Yep! I have to get the ""sensitive skin"" tape/adhesive stuff. I've had a couple of laproscopic surgeries (before cancer) where the rash from the tegaderm was worse than the incisions. If you are getting an IV put in ask for the sensitive/kids bandage. It's not 100% but it is better. Often the nurses will try to cut as small a piece as possible too. If you are just doing a blood draw ask them to use the stretchy bandage or if you can just hold the gauze for a few minutes. We're delicate flowers and that's okay 😊❤️"
mattmagikarp,I know a few people seem to be sensitive to the tegaderm dressings. The alternative that we've used is either some gauze and some micropore tape but then some people are sensitive to micropore tape. We've used cavalon spray on skin prior to using dressings (like PICC dressings) as a prophylactic which has been effective for most of our lot. Good luck!
thepurlshq,"Thank you! I keep telling them that it's a cloth tape that keeps breaking me out and that I need the HP dressing when my port is accessed. I didn't know the name of the tape, and you saved me! I do have very sensitive skin, and I'm used to having to advocate for myself for these things, and knowing names is really helpful."
Faierie1,"I have an allergy for regular tegaderm. They can only use HP tegaderm on me. It’s registered in my file, but I always have to advocate for myself on this. Annoying."
Double_Trouble_3913,Me and my daughter have this allergy my daughter had a cut on her face and needed a bandage after a day she had this bandage shaped scab on her face ... it's specific bandages for me not all are the same even the heart monitor stickies leave itchy blisters if on to long on my chest I just Vaseline it afterwards and seems to heal fast and then air dry as much as I can
nowaymary,"Joining this club. I went to a dermatologist who gave me sample size barrier creams, healing promotion creams and nourishing creams. Short answer I'm glad I didn't have to pay for any because they did nothing. Steroid cream did help heal but created other drama. Just another one of the joys"
magicpenny,"This is me. I became extra sensitive to all adhesives after lung cancer surgery when the surgeon closed my incisions with dermabond. I let my providers know and they use paper tape or coban wrap. It’s still inconvenient. I’ve had other procedures where the provider didn’t listen and used derma bond while I was sedated. That was pretty horrible. Unfortunately, it’s just something we have to deal with. It sucks, but it won’t kill you."
Thirty4MINUS_12,Looks like Two pieces of spam.
Mundane_Sky_1994,Bandage allergy rash is always a bummer. It is very common.
Mama_Ohana,"Yes, definitely a bummer. Especially since I have surgery, a hysterectomy coming up August 27. Hoping I’ll heal before chemotherapy three weeks later. My first time with chemotherapy. I’m pretty nervous about that.😧"
slythwolf,"Let the nurses know you think you've developed an adhesive allergy, you definitely don't have to keep suffering like this."
Delouest,"I always ask for the ""sensitive adhesive"" bandages because I react like this too."
Diligent-Activity-70,"I am allergic to medical tapes and glues. If I have to have something on my skin for more than a day, it looks like I have serious burns where the tape was. Paper tape is slightly easier on me than plastic tape, but all od it causes reactions that look like your photos."
Mama_Ohana,Thank you for your reply. I have noticed that the paper tape they put on my arm when they drew blood at ER did not affect me at all. I will mention that to the surgeons. Thanks again.
tamaith,"yes, I have a tape allergy that was discovered when I was much younger, tegaderm does not cause the redness but I still get itchy so that is one alternative. Can always wrap in gauze and tape over the gauze if it gets too bad."
Mama_Ohana,"Thank you, that’s a good suggestion. Last night I put the ointment on the sores, then gauze on top and then I wrapped it in atensor band. Seems to have worked so far. I just haven’t taken it off yet because it feels good. 😆"
iSheree,I get this too. Skin cancer has never entered my mind.
Mama_Ohana,I’m so sorry I popped that idea into your mind! I just found it weird that it wasn’t just making a rash. It was making sores and not healing from the stickers. But I’m sure it’s just allergies. 🤕
CoconutMacaron,"They are giving you permission to remove them from your life. Do it now so you can be well rehearsed for when the tables are turned and they expect you to drop your life to help them. I know it hurts, I really do. But they will never change. You need to protect yourself from this pain."
Greeeto,"I’m sorry you’re in this situation. It is awful. I hope you are healing well from surgery. 2.5 years ago I was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer at 42 years old. My parents, like yours, are also in their 70s, in good health, and never have had cancer. There’s so much backstory, but basically my parents wanted to have my cancer fit their lives regardless of what my oncologist said and advised. I realized they were willing to put my life in jeopardy during treatment in order for them to somehow make my cancer about them. I learned that they cared even less if I live or die than I even thought before. I also learned that they were willing to go out of their way to hurt me and my children (11 & 13) when they didn’t get their way. So, I did the only thing I could which is go no contact. This is after my brother and I tried so many things: therapy, mediation, face to face convos, written letters, logical conversations, emotional conversations, etc. I had to face the fact that they don’t want to have a relationship with me where I am valued, respected, or even considered. They want me and my children as their possessions. Fortunately I live 3 states away and it makes the logistics of no contact a little easier. I totally empathize with you on being in a weird place realizing that your parents hate you. And I couldn’t imagine not doing everything in my power to help my child, regardless of age, with something as awful as cancer."
myersmjsc,"Just ghost them and move on. This has little to do with your cancer and everything to do with an unhealthy relationship. If it wasn’t cancer, It would be something else. Walk away. Build a real support network"
BetterNowThks,"One thing cancer doesn't do? It doesn't heal your narcissistic parents. Disengage from them, and embrace those people who demonstrate their love for you."
BeachBarsBooze,"I went through a similar scenario OP. Got diagnosed at 45 three years ago. My dad and I have had a strained relationship for most of my life from teen years forward, but maintained contact perhaps monthly, see each other every few years. I call to tell him I've been diagnosed with cancer, he says he's in the checkout line at Costco and can he call me right back. That 'right back' was a day and a half later. I didn't answer it and it was the last time I talked to him, and I've felt relieved to not be pretending there was a positive relationship there ever since. It disappoints me from time to time since I've got a 10 year old and am so much more involved in her life than he was in mine at any age, and he'd never made any effort to get to know her, but it passes quickly. Post-treatment, I've just really developed that much more appreciation for the people in my life that I care about, where it's reciprocated, so I focus on those relationships."
reo0329,"My wife has GIST cancer, 2nd surgery, I got a post some where in the cancer sections on reddit. You can read our whole story,. We have no support from her side , parents (they act like it's not present or change subject. When brought up. Her kids never visit, 2 times in 11 years, call unless need money or help. But we have no friends where we are now, I moved her her 10 years ago for cattle biz and farming, she won't even speak to my parents. So she's unhappy and 8 will do anything for her, so we are moving 8 hours away to be near some rivers etc. I just want her happy. Especially now. I feel like we don't exist. I'm a disabled vet, and you know I need help. I'm slowly breaking down. I don't understand why no one wants to talk of this or help us. It's like a sin to talk about the C word. I wanna give my wife the best and be happy for asking as i can. Any other caregivers in this boat to? We are on Life Raft. Group. I'm slowly deteriorating. Hmmm. Anyone out there?"

oneshoesally,"You can do one of two things, pick your road. Either cut them out of your life completely and write them off as bad luck of the draw in the family department, or throw the situation bluntly in their faces and force either action or refusal. The latter will bring you back to the first road. But you will rest easy knowing you point blank asked for help, mentioned the mooching sister and her car, your lack of assistance, your need, and your feelings, and walk away with having gotten a flat out no or a stupid excuse. Unfortunately I’m afraid you will end up with your back turned walking away."
myFavoriteAlias_,"I’m so sorry. Some of us didn’t get blessed with healthy, supportive parents. My mother has been mentally ill most of my life, though, now that I’m in my late 30s, I recognize she’s a complete narcissist and maybe not as much as a victim as I previously thought. I had the same cancer as you. When I told her about the diagnosis pre-surgery/staging she said some pretty ugly things I won’t repeat here . She lives in another province, other than putting her abuse on pause for 3 months, she was not apart of my support system. Cares more about strangers and hating her ex husband (dad) than me. I went no contact 3 months post op when she started her toxic venom back up. How I’ve been coping ? I started therapy after resisting most of my life. At first I thought it was to deal with the cancer trauma and infertility, but it’s lead into unpacking my chaotic upbringing and my mother has been the sole focus so far. It’s really helping me reframe how i view it all and let go of the sadness of not having the relationship I wish we had. It all, of course, hurts A LOT, but talking about it and processing it has really lessened the impact it’s been having on me. Seeing her for who she is and not as I wish she could be has been a game changer. Their behaviour says everything about them - not you. You are worthy of love and support. It’s not your fault."
no-user-names-,"The concept of a chosen family is fantastic. Chosen family are those who throughout your life have wanted the very best for you. It could be the one teacher who really saw the child you were, or an aunt or neighbour, or perhaps a pet who loved you unconditionally. They are your chosen family, and the positive energy they gave to you freely still lives with you today. Some of us are lucky enough to have chosen family members in their lives today. Cancer is incredible at pointing out who these people are. Love them, cherish them, make sure they know how much you appreciate them. Cut your losses with people who take energy from you, or their giving is totally conditional. Cancer is hard enough, but dealing with the hurt of people who are “supposed” to care makes dealing with cancer so much worse. Reflect on your chosen family who have given to you freely, and try to focus on them. They are worthy of your love. Even if they are not with you any more, they will help you heal. Love to all you folk, from an internet stranger."
reo0329,I'm sorry this is so traumatic for you . When you have all and your the one Who has cancer.
reo0329,"I read your post again, it really hurts to feel your going through this. Almost same situation with us. Only thing is I take care of her best I can . She deserves this. She retired from teaching . I wish I could help you and everyone here. The hurting. I'll pray for you. Try to stay strong. I'm sorry for others neglect."
Iwantbubbles,"I'm sorry you're having to go through this. I have stage 4 cholangiocarcinoma. When I told my mother that I have terminal cancer and about 18 months to live, she told me ""well, everybody has something they are dealing with. I've had diarrhea all day."" I asked her if she understood and she asked who told me I had cancer. When I said the Dr, she just changed the subject. I didn't talk to her again and 3 weeks later she had a heart attack. I didn't go to the hospital or help decide the arrangements. I left that up to my brother."
Glittering_Hurry236,I’m sorry for your cancer. So very very sorry. ❤️‍🩹 There is a special kind of evil and mental illness for people like your mother and both of my parents. Normal people cannot wrap their minds around - making life worse or harder for a cancer ridden child of any age .. but they are so narcissistic and self-absorbed that they literally don’t care. I hope you have all of the support and there are miracles and I will hope and pray you are one of them 🙏🏻 Cancer just hearing you have it. And don’t know the stage immediately is terrifying - for months until you find out - and I got lucky 🙏🏻 I staged well. But it’s cancer. Anything can happen. You have to be a special brand of evil to make someone’s life even harder when they have cancer. It’s really sick. These people are truly sick. Your mother included. I’m glad you didn’t visit her. She didn’t deserve it. ❤️‍🩹
Average_Random_Bitch,"Same here. I had my first round of this (which was pretty serious with several major surgeries, 9-months chemo, desperately ill) and had zero help from family. Saw my mom making this elaborate meal for a friend who had broken a leg or something and, without thinking, said, oh, that's so nice. I wish I'd had someone do something like that for me when I was going thru chemo or even one of the surgeries. I mean, I said it without thinking and meant it as a compliment and she took it as a criticism, which upon reflection maybe she should have. She retaliated with instant over the top fury, screaming at me, spittle coming out of her mouth, etc. And now I'm going thru a reoccurrence and having chemo again and adopting my two very young grandkids and, no lie, struggling a bit altho I certainly haven't complained to them about it. They and my siblings are aware that I am fighting cancer as well as a super corrupt DCFS system, alone, which I merely informed them of, as opposed to telling them for purposes of getting any assistance. Because I've already learned that even if I were living 15 mins from them, I'd get zero support of any kind, especially emotional which is what I need maybe even more than financial RN because this is one of the hardest things I've ever done (in every aspect). I haven't received the first text, email, or phone call asking how we are (I am) doing, or of any offer to help, or how are the kids. In fact, most of the update photos and videos I send receive zero response. Zero, at all. No encouraging words for getting the kids the help they need or joy in their progress and milestone successes, or anything. It's stunningly mindboggling. But I've done this before so it's also sadly unsurprising. But their loss."
Glittering_Hurry236,"Yes. It’s their loss. I’m sorry they are terrible people. I’m also so sorry there has been a reoccurrence and I’m hoping you can nip it in the bud quickly, please don’t stress yourself out too much about DCF and the kids - that will work itself out. You need to get your health back. Tell them nothing moving forward about your kids. They do not care. My children receive nothing from my father and his second wife on their birthdays or Christmas and my sister‘s kids get cars, laptops, iPhones, condos and trips; so it has been passed down to my children the hatred - and the good news is that my 12-year-old does not know my dad or his disgusting wife. He’s only met him once, and he doesn’t know he doesn’t get gifts from them. They don’t occur to my younger child because I shielded him from them. Unfortunately I couldn’t shield my older child - they know they’ve been shunned/hated/ignored. Because my sister’s children (my older and the cousins are all well into their 20’s) so the cousins would gleefully call my older child and tell them all about the presents they got for Christmas/birthday’s from their rich grandpa and my child would ask me what they got from their rich grandpa and I would say “nothing. He got you nothing I’m sorry.” I knew better than to tell my parents I had cancer - and I had discussed in therapy that I wasn’t going to tell them because they would not offer any support emotional, physical or financial and my therapist was very clear. “Do not tell them if they cannot support you in anyway it will just upset you because they will be showing you for the last time that they do not care about you so be prepared for that,” and I didn’t tell them until a couple days before my surgery because I couldn’t fathom one of my children having cancer and about to undergo surgery and me, not knowing about it. But my gut instinct was not to tell them and that was correct and I’ll never do it again. Your mother is exactly like my dad. He got kudos for helping his sister, and helping his ex-wife and he wouldn’t get enough kudos for helping his own daughter so he decided not to and that’s fine. He doesn’t have to, but you were right to say what you said to your mom she didn’t make me she doesn’t care my mother never made me, flat on my back for two weeks barely move for a month. My mother called me the last three days in a row and she hasn’t called me since June and my surgery was May 29 and I was thinking yesterday why would she call me three days in a row? What does she want? I didn’t take any of her calls and then I decided it’s go time so when she called she starts going into her stupidity and I just started screaming and I was spitting seething with hatred on the phone and called her and my dad and my sister every name in the book and said you’re disgusting. You’re the most disgusting people I’ve ever met. I spent days and weeks and months by your bedside when all you had was pancreatitis you were barely sick, and your daughter has cancer and you never even made me a meal HOW dare you! And then I hung up because I was like you know what I’m only 10 1/2 weeks postop. I don’t need this. I don’t need a recurrence of cancer because the body keeps score and I just have to let it go. And you have to let it go. And you even have to let fights with DCF go because the body keeps score and when you have a family of origin that hates you this much eats and we have cancer… We have to let go of the people that hate us and STOP trying. Stop taking the bait and just drop the rope. I would say in your case and in my case, there’s nothing left to salvage and I’m not interested in pleasantries with whatever time I have left in my life. I could get run over by a bus tomorrow. I could have a reoccurrence who knows nobody knows, but I’m not wasting another second on people who literally don’t care if I live or die. Be well and thank you for your comment ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹🙏🏻"
sarewr,"I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I know exactly how you feel. I'm 39 and stage 3. I'm going through chemo and my parents just don't care. I feel like shit and they even expect me to take care of them. Just this week, I was sick from chemo and I had to drive my dad to his doctor's appointment and on the way there he complained about my driving and how he hates going to the doctors while I was trying not to puke or pass out. If I tell them I don't feel well and can't do whatever they ask of me, they play the victim and what kind of child I am that I don't want to help them. So, I get it. It sucks. And it hurts. I'm just trying to focus on myself and ignore them as much as I can."
PopsiclesForChickens,"My family (parents and siblings) were completely unsupportive when I was sick. I'm trying to maintain a relationship with them, because of course now that I'm in remission, they all are around again and want to pretend nothing is wrong, but it's hard. It sucks. I had my spouse and one friend who were really there for me."
Glittering_Hurry236,"Yes I have my husband tho we have been separated for many years. We are best friends; he took me to all doctors appts and surgery stayed all day., we are raising our 12 year old together and well. I have handful of best friends that called weekly daily - sent fruit and actually cared whether I lived died or how I staged and I went into therapy since the diagnosis - as I was so terrified of the c word and the staging possibilities and the surgery and recovery - so. I’ll continue with therapy. A couple weeks ago therapist asked me if my parents had been supportive at all and I said “no actually I haven’t heard from them and my mother is local and because it was a hysterectomy you can’t twist, you can’t bend, you can’t pick anything up. I had groceries delivered and would have to take each piece of groceries out of the bag one by one with my grabber put it in a box kick the box into the kitchen and then take each piece of grocery out of the box with the grabber onto the counter and then put it into the refrigerator, my mother lives five minutes down the street. She never helped me bring the groceries in.” And as I state these facts flatly because I’ve endured nothing but second-class treatment for 50 years. - the therapist took her glasses off and she looked up at me and she said, “I want to tell you that I’m sorry and that that’s not OK and nothing will ever make it right that your parents have not checked on you after you’ve had a cancer diagnosis and surgery nothing will ever make that OK and I’m sorry,” and I said thank you. I pray you stay in remission 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻"
junkman203,"I'm sorry that this is happening. The cancer and the family reactions. Life is short without cancer. Do not let them ruin any of your time. Don't be bitter about it, don't swell on it, just erase them from your life. They feel they don't need to help or support you, you should feel you don't need to deal with that. Block them on your social medias. Program your phone to send them to voicemail and don't listen to those. Shit. I got diagnosed in early July, my first chemo is soon and my port gets installed in three days. We have a friend and children over to visit today. I'm going shooting with my brother in law tomorrow. I'm not just existing. I'm doing. I'm living. I got it easy. My cancer is curable. I caught it early. But if any of my kin, family or friends acted like this I would remove them from my life. Swiftly, firmly and irrevocably. And then I would remove them from my thoughts. None of us are going to live forever. Nor are we guaranteed anything. You could live another 40 years, and I could be run over by an RV tomorrow. Do what you gotta do for your cancer, and spend the rest of your time trying to LIVE!"
[deleted],Cut him off. He’s still a monkey of the past. He’s not human.
Glittering_Hurry236,"After I was diagnosed, I started therapy and I had six weeks between diagnosis and the surgery and in therapy. I said I don’t think I’m gonna tell my family or my parents that I have cancer or am having surgery because of how shitty they have been in the past and she was very clear and said do not tell them if they cannot be supportive, and they do not care don’t bother. And a week before the surgery, I thought to myself I can’t imagine either of my children having cancer and going through cancer and life-saving surgery and having their organs staged for cancer grading and not knowing about it so I stupidly told my parents about it and my mom was like oh OK and didn’t call me for a week. Didn’t care. I was going in for surgery and was like got surgery tomorrow. And she says call me when it’s over. And I hung up. I tell my dad I have cancer and need surgery and he’s all “I’m sure you’ll do great and let me know if you need anything and I’m always here for you.” Proceeds to call me just once the night of the surgery to make sure I survived the table I guess and I never heard from him again. Asked for help on the hospital bills as he’s helped out his ex wife, his sister and even his 2nd wife’s cousin finding the best cancer team his money could buy (to no avail sadly) and for his own child. I was told nope. Can’t help you. It’s not even not helping financially when he’s helped others. There wasn’t even a text to ask how I’m feeling. It’s beyond comprehension. Yes. Not my monkeys. Not my circus."
Leek-Middle,"I'm sorry that you are going through this, sadly you are not alone. It's very good that you have friends that are supporting you, they are your true family. The first thing my mother said to me when I told her I had cancer was to ask me if I had accepted Christ as my lord and Savior because I would be going to hell if I died from my cancer if I hadn't...."
Glittering_Hurry236,"I’d say oh Jesus but … It’s unbelievable right …. If the narcissist don’t get anything out of it, you don’t matter. I’m sure my parents are getting plenty of narcissistic supply talking about my cancer with their friends. While I haven’t even gotten a single phone call or text from my own father asking me, How are you doing, while he’s probably at a country club somewhere laughing up attention for his cancer ridden daughter … I sat at my mother‘s bedside for months last year when she had a mere pancreatitis attack because she’s refused to give up salt and sodium laden foods while taking a high BP med that has pancreatitis as a severe side effect to the BP med - so she caused her own pancreatic attack and thru no fault of my own I have endometrial cancer even though I had my first child in my 20s. I have zero factors for it. I am slim and petite. I don’t eat sugar, but it’s clearly in my father side of the family as his mother and his sister died at 55 of alleged colon cancer..my ONC said my guess is it didn’t start in their colons…"
vape-o,"I think you SHOULD take it personally. How could you not? But you gotta MATCH THEIR ENERGY. You have to push down every impulse to check on them, see about them, and most of all, help them. Just stop. Let your sister do that shit. Enjoy YOUR family and your caring friends and treat the parents like the acquaintances they are. I am serious."
Glittering_Hurry236,"Yes, I agree with you 100%, when my mother had her pancreatitis attack. Her dog needed to be put down and my sister refused to do it so I had to do it while mother was milking it that she was so weak she needed 24/7 hour nursing care. It was a pancreatitis attack. It was not cancer, it was not a heart attack, it was not heart surgery. It was not brain surgery…it was NO surgery. But it’s how she decided to gain attention for herself. When it was actual cancer for me and surgery and I have a 12-year-old to take care of. I didn’t get so much as a meal as I brought her coffees and her favorite sandwiches and visited her daily. I got absolutely nothing of the same two years later. And I will never do another thing for her ever again. Ever."
PetalumaDr,"I am a retired physician with cancer but not a psychiatrist so take everything I say with a large grain of salt. Roughly 13% of our population has a personality disorder and it is not uncommon that they partner with someone who also has a personality disorder. Their children often have difficult lives because of that. You mentioned narcissistic and it is possible that they have a narcissistic personality disorder. We now know from the work of Simon Baron Cohen and others that they have broken brains with failed neuro circuits as demonstrated on fMRI, which preclude them from feeling empathy- he calls it the ""empathy circuit"" (and yes he is Sasha Baron Cohen's or Borat's cousin). Perhaps neither of your parents would really be diagnosed with a personality disorder if evaluated but it isn't totally important to the point because the concept can help you with your pain and suffering and may free you a bit from this suffering. The most prevailing theory now is that people who have personality disorders have them because of childhood trauma, which causes them to create a dysfunctional way of walking through the world, in order to get by. So they are in a sense broken before they are old enough to have their own children or get a fMRI to confirm that they lack the empathy circuit the rest of us have. So you get to decide whether to sit in the sadness and hurt of what sounds like a very abnormal parental response to your cancer, or you can choose to see it through a lens of empathy and gratitude. To see the abused 5 year olds who didn't do anything to deserve having their brains remolded by childhood trauma, to be glad that you can feel empathy, and to be grateful that they were somehow able to raise you in an environment that allowed you to feel empathy despite not growing up in one themselves. Imagine how barren your life would be if you could not feel empathy. I could be way off base but this allows you a framework to see their actions as the best they could do given what they have been given to work with in their lives. I sincerely hope this helps provide some perspective."
Glittering_Hurry236,"Thank you so much for this response very interesting! Sorry about your cancer. I hope you kick its ass!! Yes, I would think both of my parents had terrible childhoods which I do agree; my father’s mother abandoned him and his siblings to be raised alone by his father in the 50s when that stuff just didn’t happen, and my mother’s mother was an alcoholic who was drunk if she wasn’t at work, and my mother is an only child and extremely self-absorbed and narcissistic and my father was a domineering tyrant CEO Narc type. Lots of yelling and screaming from him when we were kids. I also had a sibling that died when she was 12 to a fatal genetic illness. My other sister was diagnosed with borderline personality when her daughter started showing signs of it in her early teens so my sister is actually a sociopath who has zero empathy and I on the other hand do so I might be the one with cancer, but I am the one that has a full life with friends and my sister doesn’t have a single friend in life besides her husband and she never has. So let the 3 of them be disordered together. You’d think people who lost a child 35 years ago might want to show some caring. But they did the opposite. My sister must be rolling in her grave that they didn’t even care I had cancer. That our mother who lives five minutes down the street from me, couldn’t even help me do laundry or bring in groceries when I couldn’t bend because you can’t do much after a hysterectomy for a long time and neither parent even said how are you doing or how you feeling it was if I didn’t exist just like my dad sibling you know They were glad maybe they were like we’ll get rid of two of them. I don’t know why. When two people have talked of nothing else then how sad they are that one of their children passed away 30 years ago has another child with an illness and they couldn’t care less."
zeleno1,I'm really really sorry. I forever resent my in-laws after they behaved this way when my husband was diagnosed 5 years ago. My resentment towards them is still fresh and I re-live it everytime I see them. I am not able to move past the hatred and anger even though my husband was able to. I've talked about this in great detail with my therapist and it hasn't helped.
chellychelle711,"Nope it doesn’t matter less! It hurts just as much like everyone else. I lost my mom to cancer in 2008 and in 2018 when I was diagnosed with an inherited rare genetic disorder and cancer, my dad just went on with his life. Always aloof and loves to act like it’s happening to him for drama. Cancer exposes all the cracks and dismantles the facade. It requires you to build boundaries and protect yourself. It is not selfish, it’s a way to maintain your life without being disrespected after all you went through went through. Narcissistic people assume it’s all over and you can go back to feeding their self. It’s a bucket that will never fill and the silent treatment is the rudest thing you can do to someone you “love”. It’s always on their terms and now you know what you need for yours. You don’t have to return the disrespect but you can love from afar. It is exhausting to keep up communication if you’re always the one who gets the raw end of the deal. It’s not hate, it’s the inability to use coping skills and some have some empathy. There may be some part of them that doesn’t want to deal with the possibility of losing you. And they don’t have the coping skill level to deal with it. Part of it is that things like this were never discussed. Gen X, we raised ourselves. However it’s their problem to deal with and they do not need to bring their fear and worry to you. They think what they’ve done is enough and all they can possibly handle. We can do hard things but people don’t like to be uncomfortable regardless of the situation. Lean into your friends. Ask them if they would with specific things on your calendar so they can plan ahead. Quick errands, help with housework cuz you’re not to lift much and just some couch cuddle time. You’re still a mom and your children expect you to show up and you need to identify the people in your life that show up for you. Ask your team for a referral to an onc psychiatrist or therapist that can help you through these times. It really helped me to have a neutral ear to listen and give feedback. How do you cope with this going forward? How do you make your life in survivorship? Couples therapy with your husband. Therapy with your children who need to get the fear feelings off their chest and be comforted. You are probably not going to change your parents habits or the way they do and don’t communicate. You have to learn to let go of things not in your control. A therapist can help with how you put you above everyone else. It’s a change for sure. Learn how to build healthy boundaries and maintain them. You can’t compare any other treatment or journey to yours. What happened in the past is done. We only move forward day by day and make adjustments as needed. You don’t need to forgive and forget but you have to release the energy it holds in you. Scream. Shimmy. Throw something. Get it out and close that door. When you know better, you do better. Don’t expect anything from anyone except for what you’ve asked for from people you trust. It’s really heard because your heart has all the feels for your parents and siblings. It sucks. All of it sucks. Losing physical parts of your body. Chemo. Everything. Last of all - give yourself some grace for getting to where you are. It’s a lot of work and no one knows except those who have been there. Pat yourself on the back for the things you can do and ask for help for the ones you can’t. Celebrate small victories! Have the cake! Take care"
Glittering_Hurry236,"Thank you so much for your response ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹 I’m sorry you lost your mom 😥 Yes your dad likes the drama of it. I’m sure my mother is telling everybody with ears about her daughter with cancer and how she came over twice leaving out that in 2 1/2 months she’s come over twice each for 10 minutes. As a Gen X I did raise myself. These two are no loss .. But. There’s some part of you that thinks oh I’ve got the big bad now. I actually have cancer. Maybe they’ll give a flying fuck about me because I am sick and then you’re slapped with the reality of nope, still no. Lol I started therapy when I was diagnosed which has been great. My therapist actually told me not to tell my parents because she did not think that they would be supportive because they have proved over and over and over again through my weddings. Yes, I’ve had two of them; and two children and they didn’t care about my kids either that they just don’t care about anything that pertains to me, and she said it’s not gonna be any different just because it’s cancer - they didn’t care when you were having their grandchildren. But, I felt like I have two kids, and I can’t imagine if one of them had cancer and was going through cancer surgery and I didn’t know about it because I’m a normal person so I told them a week before the surgery. And I shouldn’t have bothered and I’ll never tell them another thing about myself or my kids ever again. But. Boundaries are for us. Mine are pretty good, and I’m 2 1/2 months post op now. So I don’t need any help anymore. That’s over … my mother had a chance to help me and chose to ignore me instead. I am driving and can pick up heavy grocery bags and am back in the gym. It’s slow but I’m getting better daily. Thankfully the surgery seems to have gotten rid of the cancer and no chemo and I am praying it stays that way. God bless you all fighting the fight if it goes on longer … I was diagnosed in April and it’s hard to believe that was 4 + months ago — Like a lifetime ago. So scary. So terrifying. I’ve leaned on my husband and my friends and therapist and PT, who’s also a naturopath. I’ve had the cancer center SW call and I have a great GYN and GP now and it’s all hands on deck. Two people who’ve shown me nothing but contempt for 50 years aren’t my go to. But I thought telling them about the cancer and the surgery was the right thing to do, but my therapist was correct that family of origin members that cannot be supportive of your cancer and your journey and you don’t know what your journey is gonna be until staging so you do what you want - but I’m telling you if these people aren’t supportive it’s just gonna upset you and I was like not really I think they’re gross. This might just put the finalfork in it and did and it was meant to happen for whatever reason. Anything good or decent I ever thought those two (my parents) had in them - I realize that they don’t and they couldn’t even fake it for an adult child with cancer. They just really don’t care and that’s their bag. I lay head on the pillow at night knowing that I’m the best mother that I possibly can be to my kids when they need me and I’m not gonna turn my back on them. Not at any age."
Separate-Handle-3469,"I never been in this situation but I think the only way for you to move on or get some closure is to sit down and have this tough conversation with them. “Mom, dad. I feel like you love me less than my sister. You barely visited me after my surgery. Do you not consider my cancer diagnosis serious? I feel heartbroken because I needed help and I didn’t feel I could count on you.”"
Sunlover823,I see a lot of posts about absent parents. Mine died before I developed cancer. My in laws did nothing except maybe check in via text. And when I would talk to mil she’d make it about her breast cancer from 20 years ago. My mom could be a terrible person but I know she would be here for me. Now my fil is in the hospital sick with stage 4 cancer and my husband is the one staying in the hospital with him. My mom was by dad’s side almost 24 hours a day when my dad was dying. I can’t imagine how she goes home and sleeps at night. Anyway that’s my roundabout saying that the fact that your parents are awful people has nothing to do with you. I do hope you have some support in your life because you deserve love and caring
n0tT00MuchFun,"I'm sorry you're going through this. I don't think talking to them would help. It hurts, and you probably will need to make peace with never really understanding why they are behaving the way they are. I also think it might be what my wife and I call an ""Ostrich reaction"" on their part. At least that is what it seems to be on my parents' part. Sorry if this comment is unhelpful."
Glittering_Hurry236,"All the comments are helpful thank you! And yes the ostrich theory could be in fact - because I had a 12-year-old sister die when we were kids of a genetic illness and I lived my entire childhood taking care of her, as I was 10 when she was born. She died when I was in my 20s and she was 12 so this particular harshness of not helping physically (mother) or financially (father who easily has the means. It’s medical bills. I’m not asking for cars). But, because my parents have acted so broke up over the death of my sibling all these years - now it makes me wonder if they’re glad she’s gone and wished I was gone too because of the absolute lack of interest when I have cancer. Knowing I can’t move or even drive. No help was offered. Can’t do daily tasks as a hysterectomy has you down for the count for a solid 4 weeks. And I’ve really just turned the corner at 10 weeks here. Knowing I have to pick up a 2nd job when the medical bills are mounting…as they frivolously spend $$ for my other sibling and her children. It’s as if they enjoy my suffering and want to make it so I actually do die of stress or get a reoccurrence. That’s how I see it. Thank you 🙏🏻❤️‍🩹"
Great-Push3827,"Mine is just the opposite I have stage 4 metastatic breast cancer and my kids don't call, don't come by never asks if I'm ok or need anything and basically just have stopped interacting with me at all."
Glittering_Hurry236,"I’m so so sorry to hear this. Having kids is a thankless job … My oldest child hasn’t asked me how I was doing either. They are 25. They have asked for money since they were laid off. And I’m still paying off their college loans .. so I get this also. My parents and sibling indoctrinated my older child into the “family way” of Glittering is the family garbage and be mean to her and ignore her and “maybe” we’ll be nice to you. My adult child always jumped on that (they are shunned and hated by my parents, sibling and cousins) so they decided to go on the we hate glittering train a long time ago. But they also live local and have not helped me out at all. I also don’t want it from them as they have their own issues; bipolar like my undiagnosed unmedicated sibling but at least my child takes their meds .. I’m so so sorry you are stage 4. I hope you have some support from husband or friends or chosen family. Are in therapy and can find some time to enjoy yourself in ways your find fulfilling. Cancer is a lonely scary life - stage 4 is another level of scary. I wish you a miracle ❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹❤️‍🩹"
erinmarie777,"My heart really hurts for you and for all the cancer patients who haven’t been supported like they all need and deserve. I’m just blown away sometimes by how some parents treat their grown children. I rcan’t stop thinking about my own grown children or my grandchildren. Their health and happiness means the world to me. I always try to help in ways I can and as much as I can because I know how hard life can be, and I brought them into this life. Parents need to understand how important they are to their children, and how that continues long after they are grown. I always wonder how these uncaring neglectful parents were raised. What were their childhoods like? In my case I was very neglected as a child. My mother never expressed love or affection. She really rarely spoke. I got a hug from her for the first time in my life when I was 30. She hugged me and said “take care of yourself” when I was leaving (after I paid her a rare visit). I trembled for an hour. I know that both my parents came from large families and were children in the Great Depression. Their parents had no time for them, both working constantly. Still not enough to go around. My parents were both moody and angry people who never healed from their bad childhood and were never healthy as adults. My dad became an angry abusive “functioning alcoholic” who cheated on my mom, and my mom was chronically anxious and depressed. When I was growing up, I vowed that I would shower my children with love and affection, and help them every way I could. As an adult I have worked hard to process my past, and to heal. I believe “Know Thyself” is the best advice for anyone. It is so important to be aware and mindful of your own weaknesses and strengths and where they come from, and to work on yourself every day. We can’t always control our emotions but we can control our actions. Whether you speak to your parents again or not, seek healing, find some kind of understanding if possible, and work towards being at peace within yourself. The most important thing is not to pass your unhealed pain from your wounds onto the next generation. Gabor Mate has some good books and interviews about healing from childhood trauma on YouTube. I’m so glad they caught your cancer early and you have a good chance to reach remission. Can’t tell you how much I wish that was true for my son. He has glioblastoma and it’s the worst nightmare to worry about his chances for survival for 5 years."
Glittering_Hurry236,"Thank you so much for your post, yes both of my parents had terrible childhood and they have already had a child passed away at 12 years old my youngest sibling when I was 2022 and she was 12. And that they don’t seem to care about their 50-year-old adult child with cancer kind of tells me that they didn’t really care when my 12-year-old sibling passed away, but they faked it like they did for I guess their own dramatics. I am a much more caring and responsible mother than they and I like you didn’t get my first hug from my mother until I was 40 and it was bizarre and strange because she has had no interest in me as far back as my memory can go. I’m extremely sorry for your son glioblastoma is obviously a worst case scenario, but I will certainly be praying for a miracle !! I’m glad he has the support that you were offering because trust me there’s are those of us without it and even if I had glioblastoma, nobody in my family would have cared… That’s a tough pill to swallow… you own parents hate you and like watching you suffer. It’s so unnatural .. they enjoy my suffering and always have. It’s been a fascinating and despicable case study in sociopathy. While they bend over backwards for my sibling who has treated them horribly and actually stolen from them, you just can’t make sense of it… I wish your son every wish and good will and miracle 🙏🏻"
sleddingdeer,"I’m sorry. Unfortunately, many people are disappointing in crises which is incredibly painful. First, ask for money again. See if you can get some. I say that because it’s an absolute necessity and if you can get some help, it’s worth enduring the awkwardness. I had a major medical event and agonizing recovery and also got basically no help from most of my family. It was traumatic and made me feel so unloved. It’s important to recognize and honor the depths of your wound rather than rush to forgive. I also question the need to forgive people who aren’t apologetic. If they don’t see that their behavior was wrong, the problem is ongoing. For me, I had to process my pain as trauma and it was really hard and took a long time. I had to understand how their actions touched on childhood pain so I could detangle and understand my feelings. Then I decided that it permanently changed how I felt about them. I am relieved of my obligations for the rest of my life. This isn’t to say I might willingly give and be of service, but I am completely free of a duty to anyone on this planet excluding my children. There is not a guilt string to pull in my heart. I relish this freedom. After I had processed my trauma and healed physically, I had some heart to hearts with some people (maybe you’d want to do that with your parents) where I explained how their lack of care cut deep. It felt good to say what I wanted to say and I didn’t feel the need to sugarcoat it, though I wasn’t ranting either. I came to an important understanding with one family member that carved a path to reconciliation. That wouldn’t have been possible if my pain was fresh and unprocessed. I still do not feel any sense of obligation. People define forgiveness differently, but to me it often sounds like a conditioned response to sweep things under the rug or else you’ll be an angry bitter person. I think that’s hogwash! I did deep work and have moved forward, rather than forgiving them. My internal work helped me accept and then let go of what happened which I think is important for my heart. My decision to move forward reflects my choice not to feel isolated and without family, which is an act of love for myself. I don’t want to live in exile. But I have changed and our relationships have changed. That fact helps me because it acknowledges the truth of what happened. I feel a sense of power and autonomy in my family that I never had before. I genuinely feel free in those relationships and there is value in that. I can enjoy the benefits and reject the obligations that come with family."
ckeenan9192,"They care, they just do not have the emotional capability to deal with the situation. They are scared and awkward and dont want to see you because that means this could happen to them."
LittleBigBoots30,I cannot understand why it takes one whole month for a report for a scan. Scans should be done regularly anyway regardless.
rollerG12,Seriously. I got my last scan results back within 3 hours.
gtzbr478,"Because it’s a second rate hospital and the scans are being done in another, in a system that still uses fax, in Quebec where the healthcare system is crumbling. One of the main oncology centre in Montreal is sending 10 chemo patients a day to another hospital as they had to close due to staff shortage (no idea what happens to the other patients, other hospitals I hope)."
JohnnyAppleseed23457,It is unethical to treat a cancer patient and not monitor their treatments and disease.
TrashPandaNotACat,I'm sorry you and your mom are dealing with this. You're right to be concerned about the back pain. My father's lung cancer spread to his spine. Regular CT and PET scans are very important during treatment and after.
gtzbr478,Thank you 🫶
Least-Row-3397,I'm at PMH and they didnt do a CT until just over 3 months of immuno. Yhere's something called pseudoprogression where things look larger because of the immune response. Not defending anything but letting you know that it does take months to see on scans if immuno is working..how she is feeling is a better indicator in early months.
Anon-567890,What country are you in? Can you switch to a different cancer center?
gtzbr478,"In Canada. She could try to go somewhere else, but she doesn’t want to. I think she prefers to think the doc is right not to be worried than to go through the stress of going somewhere else and worrying that it’s necessary. I’m trying to nudge her (without my info she might not even have had the May scan and wouldn’t get this next one)… but moving hospitals isn’t in the cards yet. She’ll have to really feel they make her worse first, sadly. And now I must admit I’m not that sure she could get in, as the healthcare system is crumbling, units are closing, docs often don’t take new patients, especially if they’re already taken care of (no matter the quality of care). She possibly would face months of wait… if even possible."
missmypets,Is a remote second opinion possible in Canada?
Drunktrucker,"Had vats right upper lobectomy October 2022, recovery was uncomfortable, I had a pneumothorax that would not close right away and went home with a chest tube for a couple of weeks. But 1.5 cm adenocarcinoma no lymph node involved. No chemo or radiation. Still no evidence of recurrence or metastasis last ct scan in June. 70yo male. Doing well"
FunCombination3920,Glad to hear you’re okay it gives me hope
affenage,"What kind of surgery? I am scheduled for a lobectomy by VATS next week. Using Video Assist means very small incisions and no broken ribs. Recovery isn’t a cake walk, but I will recover up to 100% of my breathing capacity in the next months. I am 63, and honestly, as a person with early stage lung cancer I am in much better shape for this surgery than most who go through it. If I was offered an option for chemo or rads instead I wouldn’t take it. If there is no spread detected, using surgery to remove the original mass is considered as close to curative as you can get, while chemo and rads are not as successful. It took me a few weeks of deep thoughts.. and melt downs.. to reach the point that I have accepted this and can move forward. Give it time and talk it over.. good luck to you and your Dad."
FunCombination3920,And also good luck to you!!
Winter-Calendar6393,I’m a lot younger than your father 28F so recovery was pretty easy for me. I was initially diagnosed with stage 3A NSCLC now stage 4; and had a Lobectomy done. I’m asthmatic as well and I had an active actinomycosis infection in my lung during the surgery. I had repeated VATS procedures and another Lung resection surgery. I’m breathing better than I did when I was first diagnosed. Just make sure his asthma is well controlled with his meds and make sure he has painkillers post surgery incase he’s in pain. Feel free to message me if you have any questions! Wishing your father good luck 🍀
FunCombination3920,His asthma is well controlled and that’s why they are even considering surgery but thank you and good luck to you too!
Bama-1970,"I had RATS (Robot Assisted Thoracic Surgery) last December for a 1.2 cm Type 1A pulmonary nodule, which consisted of acinar and lepidic type adenocarcinoma. I had three small incisions below my rib cage on my left side, one for the camera and two for the instruments. They went through my rib cage to perform the surgery, breaking a rib. I spent 2 days in the hospital. I was discharged with OxyContin, but I didn’t have to take it. I took Tylenol for pain. The surgery itself wasn’t bad. My primary complications were atrial flutter and urinary retention from the OxyContin they gave me in the hospital. All the complications were resolved within five weeks after surgery. The surgery isn’t anything to be afraid of. It’s the best chance you have for a cure. The surgery makes you short of breath, so you have to use an Inspirometer for breathing for a while and walk to build up your lung capacity after surgery. They got all my cancer and found no evidence of cancer in my lymph nodes. I have to have CT scans every six months for five years to check for evidence of recurrence. I currently have no evidence of disease with a good chance the cancer won’t recur."
WalkingHorse,"I had a RATS lobectomy a few years ago. If you want details, click on my profile to read the pinned post about my experience. I’m doing very well. I wish the best for your father! 🤍"
Wide_Criticism_771,"Lower left VATS lobectomy last November. The drainage tube was pain like I’d never experienced, and oxy didn’t cut it. After the tube, recovery proceeded fine. A breathing test is part of the pre-surgery requirements, so they’ll make sure he has ability to have work with the 20% reduction that comes with losing a lobe."
KyHa33,"If you can get it out then get it out. People want an early diagnosis because that means surgery is still a curative option. My mother has several lung and heart issues so despite her early diagnosis surgery was not an option. She was offered radiation and completed that, has visible lung damage from the radiation on her first follow up scan and she already has a new nodule in her other lung. She was diagnosed in April and we all wish surgery had been offered. You should think of chemo and radiation as the steps you take when surgery is no longer an option and something to have in your back pocket as options in case of reoccurrence or spread."
FunCombination3920,Im sorry about your mom I hope she recovers.
Curious_Mix110,"My 73 yr old mom recently had a wedge resection via VATS for early stage lung cancer. I was pleasantly surprised at her recovery. I was super nervous for the surgery (she had never had one before) and any potential complications due to her age, but things have gone smoothly on that front. Also, her roommate at the hospital had a RATS procedure and was 75. We ran into her at the post-surgical follow up appointment a few weeks later, and she looked great. All this to say, surgery can feel scary, but I witnessed two 70+ year olds get through it!"
FunCombination3920,This makes me happy and hopeful! I hope your mom lives a healthy and happy life
Limp_Trick_1011,"If surgery is an option, go 4 it without discussion. I had VAT last year, IA1 was my stage and sincerely, surgery was nothing to be afraid of. Minimal pain, drain painless...got 2 weeks of pneumotorax but it healed itself. So go for it, I also have asthma and it had nothing to do with the whole story. I had no problems breathing at any moment..."
FunCombination3920,Thank you for your answer and I wish you a healthy life
missmypets,Please know that the Duropean Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO- https://www.esmo.org/) recommends lung cancer surgery only with curative intent. Another group you made guy want to connect with is LuCE-https://www.lungcancereurope.eu/. An organization for patients and caregivers.
FunCombination3920,Thank you! The doctors say that it is curative intent
Anon-567890,You guys can always get a second opinion as there is lots to consider
FunCombination3920,We live in Sweden and second opinion is not really a thing here unfortunately
Better-Class2282,"I’m sorry you’re dealing with all of this. Thank you for sharing this. I hope you get to experience joy, and love during the time you have. As cancer patients so often we want time to speed up as we anxiously await another scan or test result, thank you for reminding me to be more focused on the present. Sending hugs and love 💕"
Positive-Act-9948,I know exactly what you mean. I went through that stage and some other self destructive ones too. Your comment brought me joy. Thank you!!!
feathernose,"Good point. I do believe your ‘healthcare team’ aka your doctors, should come up with a plan to make sure you have the best quality of life as possible. This should possibly include counseling, help to keep your house clean and livable, medications to ease any pain or discomfort.. this last stage in life should be as comfortable as possible. Do you have friends and family around that can help? I believe it might difficult to reach out to your doctors and friends and family, but please do it. You deserve the best. Do not worry about being a burden (apologies for the possible assumption, i receive palliative care and i do feel like a burden but i hope you feel better), it’s important to receive love and care. I really hope you will enjoy life to the fullest while it lasts. And i genuinely hope you’re in not too much pain. Big hugs from a stranger on the internet! 🫂"
La_Pusicato,"You are a gift, with your amazing attitude, to all of us ❣🌻🌸🌈"
ant_clip,"I am terminal on palliative, not yet ready for hospice. Palliative care is mostly about keeping me as pain free as possible. They have also helped me to redo all my end of life care documents, e.g. POLST. They gave me some info and resources regarding MAID. We do a telemed every 1-2 months where we talk about pain management, my weight, am I eating well, sleeping well, etc. They prescribe my liquid morphine and an anti-inflammatory med for something else I have unrelated to my cancer. I have found it helpful, but mostly it is reassuring knowing when it starts to get bad, I know who to call and they know me. Why not just ask your oncologist or their PA about it?"
myersmjsc,"In fairness, palliative care is not self care. It’s a specific set of strategies and actions targeted at relieving symptoms and functional difficulties to get you to the best intersection of quality and quantity of life. I would encourage you to have a direct conversation with your healthcare team about the role of palliative care in your treatment. ChatGPT didn’t go to medical school."
phalaenopsis_rose,"I hope so much for you palliative care provides that extra bit of attention you need for pain management and hopefully integrative medicine! I am also looking forward to living the best life I can with cancer (terminal but not there yet). Currently, I have my pain pretty well managed but looking for more support in treating the, ""whole person"" than the cancer itself. May we both charter our path to live out our best experiences!"
80sBadGuy,"You need it! Palliative Care was one of the first appointments they made me take after my first treatment. I wasn't ready. I said I don't need this crap. But now I do! So yeah, go get an appointment."
Impressive_Course_44,"Funny, as I was reading this, my first thought was before I even saw my onc, they had a palliative care appointment on my calendar. After my first onc visit they canceled it as they felt it was not really time to bring them in, but they were keenly aware that at some point they may be needed and were proactive about it. I was not terminal and was able to manage pain on my own, but my main medical team kept reminding me that palliative care was there if I needed them."
pathofcollision,I’m a nurse and I am so pro palliative care. Every single patient diagnosed with cancer needs palliative care. We need to do a better job of differentiating between palliative care and hospice/comfort care. They are not the same thing but patients often get them confused and healthcare professionals don’t do a good enough job at ensuring patients have the all the resources they can get to ensure they have the best possible quality of life.
No_Development8363,"I have a very stupid question. But during palliative care, is there a chance of recovery? Or is pallliative care kinda a final place but can last for years"
Sea_hag2021,"Not stupid! I find there’s a lot of confusion around the topic. Palliative care can be for anyone. I am not terminal, but after my very first oncologist apt, my dr set me up with the palliative care team. Their whole deal is managing the side effects of cancer treatment, regardless of where you are in the journey. I only met with the nurse practitioner for most of my appointments, but she worked in tandem with a mental health counselor and spiritual advisor if that was something her patients wanted or needed (I did not). They also said that if my partner or any caregiver needs support, they can also meet with the palliative team. The nurse has told me that she’s available to help/take appointments even when I’m not in active treatment. Im really sorry people aren’t told about palliative at the start. They were key in getting me through chemo and I leaned heavily on them throughout."
madturtle62,"I am sorry you are at this point in life. I am a nurse and cancer patient. I used to be a part of a multidisciplinary palliative care team in a previous job. Pal care should be brought up at the time of diagnosis. It’s not just for people who are in the last stages of life. Pal care is for people who have serious, life limiting illnesses. They are experts in symptom management."
Alternative_Cow_5868,Also ‘terminal but not end stage’ here - thank you for a timely reminder. Sending love ❤️
PetalumaDr,"Excellent point. I was fortunate enough to be given an early appointment with a Palliative Care/Symptom Management doctor when I received my initial terminal diagnosis. It has allowed me a forum to discuss not only symptom management but goals of care. My understanding is that some areas of the country are understaffed with Palliative Care doctors, which may or may not be the case in your situation."
ShoppingHot4314,Wowwwwww I wish I had heard about this sooner I still kinda want to learn more but I’ve been wanting for mentally deal with the bone cancer blood clot and breast cancer for the last 7 years and nobody has ever offer this friends always say I should join a support group and the Reddit is as far as I know till now so thanks alot I’m going to ask my dr
Justawoman76,I was never offered palliative care until I was sitting there and I went from a stage to terminal and given months to live I brought it up . I was immediately referred and my life has been changed to the better what is left. We have been working on managing the pain they have gotten me a bed I can sleep in they offer to speak to me about my feelings they have got me home health. I should and everyone should be offered these services. I have been blessed with an amazing palliative care team! I also felt like a burden to my children and they have released these feelings and emotions. My children are also angels to me! Please don’t hesitate to ask for anything from your doctors for palliative care totally changes everything for you!!!
rachrachcalero,"If I knew more about palliative care, I would have done so much more with and for my dad. I try to lie and say I did what I could but I swear we could have done more together. Good on you for taking charge of the time you have. I’m proud of you, sending you strength and love. Experience is everything in your grasp :)"
StrangeJournalist7,"As far as mutations go, our bodies are making them all the time. Usually, the immune system says ""nope"" and takes care of them, sweeping them into the body's garbage disposal. Every so often, though, something funky slips under the radar and starts to grow. It just happens."
Kimmus2008,That's a great analogy!
FeralTee,"I'm terribly sorry this is happening to you. Sending you positive thoughts and best wishes for recovery, best possible health, and happiness. Getting the diagnosis sucks... Dealing with cancer sucks.. But it's important to find your reasons to enjoy whatever you can.. It makes life worth living. 💕"
nzbluechicken,"Becoming Deadpool would have been way cooler for sure! Love your humour, that's exactly how my sister and I cope too. Have you got support? I found taking notes helpful against the brain fog, and my sister would often take in the information while I sat like a stunned mullet nodding stupidly. You're so young and I'm sorry you're going through this."
[deleted],Having support definitely would make things a little less stressful but unfortunately my family abandoned me when I was 16 so I've been on my own ever since. I'm homeless and don't have the funds to get food or water which probably makes things worse lol. I just try to ground myself by focusing on my senses and the things around me. I really hate complaining I just needed a little space to vent to anyone who would listen. I just hope I can figure everything out. Thank you for your kind comment.
Urawinner1945,"Hey there! I'm sorry you're having to go through this, and if it's any help, I'm here for you. I (edit: 24M) was diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma about 2 months ago, (it's also a blood cancer), and I know I was terrified for a bit before I started to come to terms with it, and what it means. The most important thing to remember is that it's okay to feel. It's okay to feel scared, mad, upset, or anything else. Let yourself feel your emotions, and do your best to handle them in a safe, healthy way. Some things that helped me were remembering that my DNA (and presumably yours too!) didn't decide to mutate all of a sudden, what almost certainly happened is that like happens almost every day, a few cells messed up when they did their growing thing. Usually the body is really good at catching this, and killing and recycling the cells before they cause any issues. How a cancer happens is that the body just missed a cell or two, and happens to miss them enough times that it grows to a point where the body can't stop it on its own. There is good news though, for starters, is that you caught it! The first step to dealing with any issue, even one as scary and daunting as this, is knowing what the problem is. If you haven't already scheduled an appointment with an oncologist to figure out your stage, and what your treatment will be, that's your best next step. I'm not gonna lie to you and say it's gonna be a fun time dealing with this, but it's not gonna be the end of the world either, after all you've had your cancer for at least long enough for a symptom to show that made you get it checked out. The big change is that now you know what's going on with your body, and can work towards fixing it, so you can get back to what you were already doing. Do what research you can about your cancer, so you can ask your oncologist the questions that matter to you. Listen to your doctors, and reach out to your support people when you need them. If you need extra support, we're all here for each other. Try to stay positive, and make sure to still make time for your hobbies and interests. Hang in there, and fuck cancer 💜"
TTlovinBoomer,"I’m sorry to hear this, it’s terrible news at any age, but especially when you are so young. But keep that sense of humor up. It will help you immensely. And don’t beat yourself up or focus on the why did this happen to me (easier said than done). I say this with love, it happened. You now have to hit it head on and deal with it. I don’t know much about leukemia except that it fucking sucks. Like all cancers do. Have a friend dealing with it for 12 years and he’s still going. So there is hope. Hang onto whatever you find that makes you hopeful. Also feel free to feel whatever way you feel. It’s your life. We all are given just 1 of them. It’s up to you and only you what you make of it. So make it the best life you can for yourself. You are going to soon find out who your true friends and family are. Ignore the nonsense. You will figure that out as you go through this. Know idea where you live or your financial/insurance situation. But if you are in the US, understand we have some of the greatest medicine in the world. Probably the best. Some of the best cancer doctors out there. Maybe the best. But we have a complete fucked up way of monetizing it. And a completely fucked up way of handling the financial strain and toll it will take on you. Because so many value money more than life and that’s a sad reality. But there are tons of resources out there to find. Keep asking questions and keep seeking help when you need it. Advocate for yourself. Don’t go overboard and be demanding or pushy or dwell on things 24/7. But if your doctors aren’t explaining things or if you have questions, please ask. Please press for answers. It will be overwhelming at times. But you will get the hang of it. Find your support group. Whether that’s 1 person or many. Cling to them when you need them. Tell them when you don’t. Ignore people who have anecdotal tales of cures and remedies. Ignore those who have a friend of a friend or an uncle that they try to compare you to. Or they say died or has survived for x, y and z reasons. Those people they are talking about aren’t you. Each patient is different. And a great doctor will know the differences, your friend or family member won’t. Stay positive, but don’t go crazy or feel ashamed or bad when you get negative, because you will at times. That’s ok. You have to deal with things as they come, and they may come fast. Best advice I think I can give is live your life. Find peace and joy and love wherever you can and get rid of anything, including people, who don’t bring you peace joy and love! It may not mean much, but there are thousands and thousands and thousands of us who know exactly where you are mentally, and 99.999999% of us are rooting like crazy for you and everyone else facing this fucking disease. Best wishes to you, and may you find peace, joy and love in everything life throws your way!!!"
chellychelle711,"I am so sorry that you have already been through a lot in your life. You cannot change what is in the past and you are in charge of everything going forward. First, you didn’t do anything to get this, no one deserves this, the shit just mutates. There’s no one to blame or be mad at. I inherited my gene mutation from my mom and my siblings didn’t. I was diagnosed with MDS/bone marrow failure at 45. You can be angry at cancer and will go through lots of emotions. There will be a social worker to help you with logistics and finances if needed. Seeing a therapist to help you deal and cope really helps. Check out LLS.org for all the info you may need. They are very helpful and have lots of resources including financial help. Super friendly on the phone too. You are not alone, you now have a whole community around you. The whole situation is shit. So now you know that your body is sick. You will feel fatigued and groggy until they start killing it. You may get blood or other blood products to keep your levels up. You can take naps and conserve your energy. You may have breathless moments when your blood volume is low. Eat a high protein diet and work to stop smoking. You can have edibles if it’s legal in your state. And you’ll need to consider staying a bit quarantined so you don’t catch anything while out and about. Any illness could make you very sick. You don’t want anything to delay your next steps. The current covid strains are pretty easy to pick up. You will want your body in the best shape (rested, fed, hydrated) going into treatment if you choose treatment. You always have choices on this journey and deciding whether you get treatment or not is the big ones. You are very young and this is a marathon but you are always in control. Don’t listen to any snake oil or crackpot advice. Alkaline water or magnets or some special oil or a retreat in Mexico will not kill the cancer. There’s only one way and that’s to blast the hell out of it with chemo and other treatments as directed by your doctor. Even since I had chemo and my stem cell transplant almost 6 years ago, the treatments and advancements in blood cancer have been significant. You have the cancer now, so quitting sugar or going vegan or exercising profusely won’t help. Quitting smoking or moving to a patch to get off will be vital to your recovery because nicotine constricts the blood vessels and you need all the blood you have flowing freely. We don’t compare our cancer journeys. No one’s is more or less than yours. It is a unique experience because of your DNA. Your team will suggest a treatment plan that is specifically designed for you. Again, you didn’t do anything for this to happen. There is always help to be found. Ping me if you have any questions. The Leukemia forum is great too once you learn more. Take care 💜"
wisteria_town,"OP I'm 17 & also have blood cancer (acute myeloblastic leukemia). So sorry you had to join this shitty club. There's honestly no real reason why your DNA just decided to mutate, it just happens. It happens to all of us but like someone else said, your immune system usually just takes care of it. But sometimes it goes unnoticed far too long. r/leukemia might be a worthy sub to visit if you'd like. Best of luck 🤍"
farleybear,I also had AML at 17. Stay strong friend ✊
Defiant-Aerie-6862,"This community are great listeners, welcome in. I’m sorry for what you are going through"
Displaced_in_Space,"FYI, polycythemia is a form of leukemia. Are you saying your poly somehow changed into another form of leukemia? I only even know about this cancer as my older sister (in her mid 60s) was recently diagnosed during one of her routine breast cancer follow ups (5+ years clear). But I've read a bunch about it and basically once you get the right meds schedule, this should have very little impact on your life & longevity. (at least that's what she was told and what we've researched). Is your oncologist telling you some dramatically worse prognosis?"
Takoska_,"I'm so sorry to hear that. A diagnosis like that is a life-changing experience. Leukaemia is a type of cancer that in most cases is not your fault. No behavior or diet is to blame. Mutations happen all the time. Most of the time, your immune system is there to kick the degenerated cells in the ass. But sometimes cells manage to trick the immune system. Boom, you got cancer. But leukaemia is now quite treatable, better than some tumors. Even if blood cancer sounds frightening at first, you have a good chance of coming out of it unscathed. I don't know much about myeloproliferative types, though. The most important thing is that it's okay to be afraid. Even if others may be worse off. I had leukaemia when I was 15. I'll be 20 this year. At first I was afraid. I didn't know what I was going to do with school or my private life. But I realized that you can still enjoy life with cancer. Sometimes life even becomes more beautiful. You gain a completely different perspective on life. Life itself and being alive becomes something beautiful to enjoy every second, especially if you don't know how long you will stay. I've realized that I'm really interested in my therapy and my illness. Next year I'm starting my medical studies. If you can't get anything positive out of your situation, that's OK. It's absolutely OK to feel fear, anger and despair. Ask at your clinic if there's a psychosocial service. They'll be able to help you. Even if it's just a normal conversation in the midst of all the clinic madness."
funkygrrl,"I'm the moderator of r/MPN for people with Polycythemia Vera, essential thrombocythemia and myelofibrosis. It's not clear from your post whether you found out you have Polycythemia Vera (PV) which is a chronic blood cancer or whether it progressed to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). If it's PV, the first line treatment is now Besremi, an interferon that will potentially slow or prevent progression and make you feel better. If it's AML, that's more complicated. As far as the mutations go, they are finding that we acquire the mutation in utero or early childhood and it remains dormant for a very long period of time before starting it's shenanigans. Our sub has a wiki page on the genetics of it. Feel free to come to the sub and ask questions or you can DM me."
st4bma5terars0n,I was diagnosed with blood cancer last week and am also scared. I am trying to make sense of it too but am learning that sometimes things just happen and it's part of nature.. I guess
CancerSucksForReal,Are you still homeless now? Do you have insurance? A cancer diagnosis at 22 sounds really hard.
Coffeespoons101,It’s awful and of course you should be scared. It’s not the end of everything though - check out Luke from Bristol2Beijing if you want to see a young person doing stuff despite blood cancer.
Ok_Studio6379,Read the books of andreas moritz about cancer. It'll help you tremendously to heal.
PetalumaDr,"I'm not sure that there is a way as a human being to be hit with this info and not feel overwhelmed. There will no doubt be many ups and downs. Few of us ""thought this would happen to us"". Your doctors, nurses, therapists, ... deal with overwhelmed people all day and the good ones will be life rafts for you as you feel yourself drowning in the uncertainty, mortality worries,... I would strongly suggest getting an Oncology Psychologist ASAP if one is available locally and you can fit it into your insurance/finances. They see overwhelmed people all day, every day and can help you navigate all of the uncertainty and worries that are both universal and unique to your situation. Good luck."
Cookielipz49,"As a fellow warrior on cancer’s battlefield you have my sympathy, and empathy. Please don’t spend another second wondering about, or trying yo figure out the, “Why.” I appreciate human inclination leads you/us that way. Here, it is a useless energy expenditure. So, you received a cancer diagnosis, have you also received, or do you have a, “Treatment plan” pending? This would be next step- Treatment plan/staging. Cancer knocks the snot out of us far and large. I could lean forward from couch to grab something off coffee table and fall asleep mid reach for 2 to 82 minutes. Totally nuts, but, part of the deal in my experience. What is next for you in your circumstance? Do yiu have family to reach…."
WhodatSooner,"I am so sorry. Yes, it’s very scary when you learn that there is no cure for your particular brand of cancer and even the oncologists can only say something like “maybe 2 years but prepare for 3 months”. I made my 2 years and there have been many of those days I would like to give back. I would have preferred 3 months without pain to 2 years of this but then every once in awhile I manage to string together maybe 5 good days in a row. So I have no wisdom to share other than to try to recognize that it’s ok to feel like shit. Don’t feel bad about feeling bad. Try to allow yourself to take advantage of the better days somehow. Anything to make that day different will do. Sometimes that means I have enough energy to cook and feel good enough to actually eat some of it. And don’t take any shit from anyone ever again. I was a smoker and like you, what I have is entirely unrelated to that according to every oncologist I’ve talked to and all of the research I’ve done on my own. But at the beginning I had to hear that shit from some people and then there were other people who I knew were saying that about me because I knew what catty gossips they were. I cut them all out of my life completely. In fact, I cut everyone out of my life other than my family and my two closest friends. I actually put together a message I sent out to well meaning people who with good intentions would call or text me to “check in.” I couldn’t fucking take it so I told them all that I was cutting them out and my reason for doing so. I didn’t apologize. That was something I needed to do to get by so I did it. Maybe you prefer more attention and if so then by all means cultivate those relationships. The point is it’s ok to be selfish in this regard one way or another. I have six children (ages 32-16) two grandchildren and a wife I absolutely adore so those are plenty o feelings for me to be concerned with now. Not my old law partners or old teammates or anyone else. Also, for me, marijuana is very helpful and it’s a little known secret that anyone can get it mailed to you legally unless you live in Idaho. I get mine from Mood or Cheech & Chong. For me, I had awfully bad experiences with all of the opioids and narcotics. They even tried some sort of steroid on me and I literally went into a full blown roid rage. Scared the living shit out of everyone including me. I do take the slow release OxyContin three times a day so I’m officially a junkie (it’s a living hell if I miss a dose; the withdrawal symptoms kick in hard and fast), and I take gabapentin for nerve damage caused by spinal tumors but that’s it other than weed. It’s absolutely criminal that we are made to believe that we can’t use it legally unless we live in a state that has “legalized” it. I live in Texas and UPS delivers my weed to my front door. No problem and there’s not a goddam thing that someone who doesn’t live in this body can do about it. And hang in there with us. Finding this sub has been so important for my mental health. Give us a try and see if it works for you too. ✌️❤️🫵"

SoloAsylum,"There is no ""age"", it's under reported because a majority of narrow minded doctors think exactly like that and tell people who have blood disorders exactly that, and if there's no diagnosis there's no report of it. The modern day diets, stresses, air quality and chemicals that surround our everyday life make anything possible health wise."

You are in the worse leg of the journey, the lack of information can be torture. There is nothing wrong with talking to a therapist that specializes in cancer patients. Wish you the best for your appointment tomorrow. Getting past this first one will help."
Defiant-Aerie-6862,Thank you 😊
EntertainmentLazy716,"First off, a diagnosis of cancer can and will cause some significantly wild emotional rollercoasters - yes, this is very normal. What you're describing sounds very normal. What I would strongly encourage you to do is speak to someone, specifically someone who deals with patients who have or had cancer. They can help you develop tools to manage the emotions. If this becomes overwhelming, please consider discussing whether you could benefit from medication to assist you with the worst of the rollercoaster rides. In short - yes, this is common, and it can get better, but it's not a linear thing - some days will be better than others. Having a plan of how to manage things and what's happening going forward will make a big difference too. Good luck tomorrow"

KitchenLab2536,"I was told before chemo started that with it, I’d have an 88% chance of five years survival. Comforting much of the time, but sometimes in the quiet moments I would wonder, “What if I’m in the 12%?” Cancer is scary. It just is. Once you meet with your oncologist you’ll have a plan with which to move forward. Having a plan helps to put you in control can give you hope and, hopefully, optimism. Everyone on this sub is rooting for you. We completely understand what you’re going through. Godspeed."

moseyeslee,"Yes very normal. Bladder cancer last year. Active immunotherapy. NED currently. My diagnosis was sudden. Down the first hill of the coaster. Before I knew i was likely to survive, I spent alot of time in bed and detached. Sometimes everything else moved quickly and I was inbslow motion. Always in deep thought. I gave things away to my friends, told the close ones goodbye just in case. Started setting up my wife for life without me around. Did alot of crying. I was mourning my life and what was possibly left of it. I was 48 years old. They found spots on my lungs mid game, and it was about 9 months before I knew those were benign and my current bladder cancer was isolated to my bladder. I now have a 70ish percent chance of getting high grade bladder cancer, and intravesicle immunotherapy lessens my chances of repeat tumors. It was a rough year. Many hills and loops on this coaster. 1 year later, I feel as if I'm on level track. Sometimes it speeds up and heads toward a hill, then flattens again. Couple small bumps. But ya know, I'm still here. I was positive I'd be dead by my next birthday and I just turned 49. I'm still scared, but I'm ready for death now when it finds me. I feel lucky though, many people don't get a chance to see what it's like to prep for death. We got a bit of practice in. Good luck and stay strong like you have been. Every day above ground is a day not to be wasted. Much love.."

FeralTee,"I'm still in this position. Still having sudden ups and downs. I think the worst thing is the hope.. Yes, I know how that might sound.. Worst outcome means no more worrying.. Wondering.. I hate that I can even think that. My surgeon told me to expect just over half a year to possibly as much as three to five years. I was broken after hearing that. I couldn't function and still have difficulty when I think about it. My oncologist told me he wouldn't guess about timelines. He has given me a bit of hope.. There are survivors (depending on the study..) 55%..or 37%..the 15%..or the 2%.. If I go by the studies and papers.. I'm in the 2%. It's easy to slip into worst outcome scenarios. But i am doing my best to see all the positives.. I watch my blood work like a hawk and calculate some equations that are shown to indicate prognosis. If something is slipping, I do my best to try and right it. The rabbit holes are out there.. Lol.. And I slip down them pretty often!! I just try and stay away from the papers/studies that are primarily about overall survival. My thoughts and warmest wishes for best health and happiness go out to you and yours. 💕"
iSheree,What you are experiencing is very normal. I went through this when I was first diagnosed.
mfatty2,"The thoughts, especially before you get a full care plan in place are definitely normal. I had one doctor tell me he was certain my swollen lymph nodes weren't related to Lymphoma but we needed a biopsy. After it came back inconclusive, and we needed a larger sample he said ""we're not sure but it could be cancerous"" my thoughts started running wild. It turns out it was Hodgkins Lymphoma and was progressed from my neck into my lower abdomen. There were even a couple of spots on my kidneys (extremely rare for HL), found that out because I went into kidney failure before my biopsy surgery, and the hospital I was in got me on a schedule quicker. Now before I went into kidney failure, I had been talking with my now fiancee about whether or not she still wanted me to propose with the possibility of a cancer diagnosis. If she wanted out instead of possibly watching me die. I went into the hospital with kidney failure 3 days after I proposed. I thought for sure I was going to die in that hospital. Once I got my diagnosis, roughly 10 days after I was hospitalized, there were times where one moment I was certain I was going to die, and then the next I was certain I was going to fight like hell and be able to forget all of this happened. Nearly a year later and my cancer has been pushed back into only my neck. I will need a second treatment (just found out last Friday) but the first round wiped the cancer out of my abdomen completely. I no longer have those rollercoaster thoughts. Good luck to you, I'm never going to claim it gets easier but you do figure out what works for you and it helps keep the anxiety at bay. Everything you are feeling now is valid and normal."
DarthButtercup,My cancer is very treatable (GIST) and my prognosis is pretty good but I found the handouts on palliative care and hospice my oncologist gives to everyone a little triggering so I got an end of life journal for planning. I’m in my 50s so it’s a good time to be sure I’m ready for anything and I find this type of planning soothes my anxiety.
Defiant-Aerie-6862,"I am mid 50’s also, so regardless, I would like to journal and maybe do some letters. Maybe it will help my anxiety. Thank you 😊"
PetalumaDr,"Yes- very normal and you have already chosen the most functional response to this very common but overwhelming situation- to seek the counsel and wisdom of experts that comes from experience, which makes this situation ""normal"" in their work world. I was given a grim prognosis and rushed to get my affairs in order and to get a good second opinion. What you need is shepherding to help you come to the realization that most of us die and leave our families sooner than we want to, or have partners die and leave us sooner than we wanted them to (whether it is in your 20s or 80s). It almost seems like a shock to me in retrospect that most of us go through life without understanding that basic fact. The Stoics and many others tried to convey this to us through their teachings. I hope for you that it ends up being many many decades in the future. Good luck."
Constantlearner01,"Sometimes I feel like the realization of the mortality sits on the headboard, waiting patiently and when I wake up, jumps from the headboard to my shoulders and then I say “oh yeah, that’s right, I have this cancer with extremely high rates of recurrence” and realize once again time is limited and this is my world now. When I was first diagnosed, people with high survival cancer rates would say “You Got This” and “I Got Through This and So Will You.” But then you realize not all cancer is the same and some cancers haven’t had much research progress in 40 years!"

They could figure out how I was even conscious! They gave me a week, tops. When they agreed to try chemo, they told me my odds still were worse than what the pamphlet said just because of the sheer amount of cancer. But my friend still insisted she knew better. This was back in ‘07. So…I guess she was kinda right? I honestly I don’t think my survival had anything to do with my odds, and was more about the positive attitude and pure dumb luck. Scary thing is, I heard she went into nursing…I hope she learned how to listen to others!!!"

magicpenny,"Of all the stupid things I’ve ever imagined someone might say to me about having cancer (also a blood cancer), denying there’s such a thing as blood cancer has never crossed my mind. What a raging dickhead that guy was."
CancerSucksForReal,You get a medal for not stabbing him with a steak knife. He is such a dufus.
Aware-Marketing9946,Hmm. I'd have probably flipped the table. You're a better woman than me. 😉
Opening-Kick7411,"I feel you . I was told by a couple friends and even a DR ! the same words almost. I had Synovial sarcoma in my foot , and they said that there Wes no such thing . I was so angry, especially since the Drs. amputated my led from the knee down. I didn’t stay friends with them either ."
Faierie1,That guy is not a keeper

LetaEaglefeather,I would just ask him when he got his medical degree with a specialization in cancer. When he says he don't have one that is when I would say then don't speak about what know absolutely jack shit about . For icing on cake print out the paper on jack shit it funny. On a side note I hope you go into remission soon love you are in thoughts and prayers. . I don't envy the road you now walk but know we are here to help as we can as support. Be well
PetalumaDr,Dunning Krueger textbook case. He is lucky you didn’t laugh at him. That would have really made him cry. Good on you for ending things there.
Superunknown11,Better off without that moron.
junkman203,You are brave. And strong. We are all rooting for you.
dkdelicious,That guy is an absolute idiot. Sorry you had to go through that and good luck with treatments.
PhoneRings2024,I just got diagnosed with CLL as well . My doctir told me I have leukemia which is cancer of the blood. He is not only ignorant but insensitive. Having negative people in your life is not good. If I didn't know what it was I'd look it up so I could understand. If he doesn't believe it's cancer what happens if you do chemo and radiation and are sick?? I hope you have friends or family to help you. Ditch this asshole.
Many-Interest5614,"I’m very sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Please search Dr. Brian Druker — Gleevec.

DemonCipher13,"The only word, the only visceral thing, I've been able to come up with to describe that person, is refuse. As in trash. I'm so terribly sorry that you didn't have the heights of support, because you were most assuredly entitled to that from whatever partner you had/have/will have. But, as it stands, I hope for your treatment success, and hope you have a long, happy life to come, yet. Wear your badges with pride."
[deleted],"So…you have CLL, Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma AND Paget’s Disease?"
vaginalvitiligo,"Soooooo.... I have CLL which through Richter's transformation has now evolved into what's known as richters syndrome which is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. I also have Paget's disease of the male breast which is ""unrelated"" as the doctors like to keep reminding me. It's just there for extra flavor. And since that wasn't enough, I also have CANOMAD, which stands for chronic ataxic neuropathy, ophthalmoplegia, immunoglobulin M [IgM] paraprotein, cold agglutinins, and disialosyl antibodies. This disorder has been diagnosed in less than 1,000 people throughout the world since 1985. It is enjoying its time turning my hands into scribbles. It's just fun time fun time fun time over here in this body. Which is why I'm constantly gambling and buying lottery tickets and actually winning because I'm literally that person who is one in a million."

tangerinedr3am_,"He’s got some pretty big balls.. Tell him he better get them checked soon, or does he not believe in testicular cancer either?"
ygbplus,Did he ever say why he thought there was no such thing as blood cancer? Does he not know that at the basic level cancer is any cell in your body that fails apoptosis and continues to replicate and that blood is made of cells? How wild.
NataschaTata,"If there’s no blood cancer, then I don’t actually have cancer, and I’m healthy as a peach! Fuck me, I didn’t know it was that easy to outsmart the system… can’t believe I actually don’t have blood cancer, today is a great day!"
ICanEatABee,Hows your diagnosis looking nowadays? I remembered you from the post and thought you died. I'm glad to hear you're still with us.

grannygogo,"This reminds me of the time I was out grocery shopping and was walking my cart back to the cart corral. A woman in her 40s stopped me and asked if I would help her put her groceries in her SUV trunk. “You wouldn’t know it to look at me but I have a bad back”, she said. So of course, I, a 73 year old woman, said okay and helped her unload her groceries. When she started to get in her car without so much as a smile or a thank you, I went right up to her and said, “You wouldn’t know it to look at me, but I have leukemia”. I stared at her dumbfounded expression and I walked away."

And these types of cancers are in the marrow, not the actual blood itself. However, sometimes these diseases can change the shape of your platelets/cells to the point of where they malfunction. I had to be tested for this…"
erinmarie777,I feel so sorry for people who are dating these days. I’ve heard so many crazy stories about guys who start out okay but turn into complete weirdos on dates. But dating after being diagnosed with cancer might be a real trip for you I’m afraid. Even friends and family can say the wrong things and give ridiculous advice sometimes. I love your self confidence. Keep smiling. Keep venting your experiences. I hope you don’t meet too many more toads before you find someone who was raised well and can become a trustworthy best friend and a real supporter for you. You deserve that. Everyone does.
tpgnh,I've had similar conversations and I am impressed you didn't punch him in the throat. Best of luck One day at a time. One foot in front of the other. And a lot of long slow deep breaths.

TampaBob57,"Losing your job, how?File for FMLA at the least and use that (and while you are off from that look for another job) at least you keep the health benefits while out on FMLA."
visionquester,"Can you revisit the WFH request and put in timelines that you will revisit the accommodation? When I got WFH, HR was loathe to allow anything that didn’t have a measurable timeline so we compromised and said WFH for three months and revisit need at that time. Luckily for me, HR never revisited the accommodation and it’s been in place for an extended period of time. I think they just forgot."
rosiepinkfox,Apparently I had 60 days that no one told me about until 2 days before it was up I found out on accident. They gave me two more weeks after I asked for an extension
iSheree,My partner lost his job caring for me. Unfortunately this is all too common. He was a warehouse labourer so working from home wasn't even an option. I am sorry this has happened.
pathofcollision,"When my mom was diagnosed with terminal cancer, I worked as a nurse in a toxic work environment. I was torn between knowing I needed to leave for my mental health and feeling like I needed to stay because I wouldn’t be eligible for FMLA if I started over someplace else, even though I knew my manager wouldn’t care about my situation. We had a nurse on our unit in her 30s that got diagnosed with advanced triple negative breast cancer and when she disclosed to our boss, our boss legitimately responded with, “how do you intend to continue working?”…because that was her priority, not fighting for her life. It wasn’t an easy decision, but I left. I took the risk. I was hired on at my current job. I let my boss know my circumstance immediately and let her know I would be eventually called to care for my mom, it was a matter of time. It ended up being only a matter of three months before chemo stopped working and we had to transition to hospice. My current boss, knowing I wasn’t eligible for leave, accommodated me in every way she could to ensure I was able to stay employed as a single mom who was caring for her dying mother. Trust in the timing of things. Go be with your family. On a side note, the genetic testing was something I did when my mom was diagnosed and I am glad that I did. No one can advocate for you better than you can. If you know what you’re predisposed to, then you know exactly what to push for when it comes to screening. Early detection makes a huge difference. I am sorry you are going through this, I know exactly how hard it is to walk through."
nygenxmom,Can you have a social worker at one of your relatives’ doctor’s office or hospital write a letter to indicate that you’re the caregiver?
4everKni8,"Thats so messed up, can't imagine the shit you have been dealing all this time, take care, and get yourself checked as well, no point in delaying"
USBlues2020,"Hire an excellent Employment/ Labor Attorney using your company as how not to treat people who are reaching out asking person to work, accommodating their schedules to be care givers to biological family (parents, sisters and brothers, wives/husband's and children etc...)

silverbax,My company gave me WFH because cancer is an ADA exception. Please look into it.
iSheree,"I don't think that applies to caregivers does it? I am not in the US so I have no idea what the ADA involves. Here in Australia, carers can do a flexible workplace agreement but employers don't like it and will find any excuse to fire you. Thats how my partner got fired for caring for me."
Justawoman76,Please please get the testing done. I’m incurable and going to pass away soon I made or asked all my children to go do the genetic testing. I did it 10 years ago and was negative but my daughters was not. I also lost my job even though they let me work remotely when I broke my leg and ankle on the job. Now they are begging me to come back to work remotely because they can’t find anyone else to do the job as well as I did their words not mine! Of course it could be something to do with being sued for not offering FMLA to a cancer patient etc. I couldn’t do the job now anyways due to the severe pain and sickness etc of this cancer. Please please please do it and don’t be scared the sooner you find out and start taking control over your health the better the outcome is for you!!!! I’m sorry for all the pain and suffering that you’ve endured due to the loss of your family.
rosiepinkfox,I just wanted to follow up that I’m getting the testing done. Scheduled for January
smartypants333,"I was let go because I personally had cancer, and requested to continue to work from home for 3 additional months (in 2021 when Covid was still in full effect!) Companies aren't messing around with this RTO BS. And although I probably could have sued, I didn't want to waste my time. If I didn't sign away my right to sue they wouldn't give me my 2 months severance."
KTMan77,"If you gave a time frame of 5 years perhaps that works fill the dumb check box for HR. Take care, you’re having a rough go of things lately."
AdventurousSleep5461,"Honestly I would talk to an employment attorney and see what they advise. In another comment you mentioned there was a deadline that you weren't told about, so I would get documentation of that and any emails regarding your requesting WFH to care for a close family member and take that with you. Just forward the emails, and any future ones, to your personal email account. Also if you have any proof of them accommodating another employee so they can buy a house and move bring that as well."
SpeedingTourist,I am so sorry OP.
Cookielipz49,Pls get yourself checked. A fear worth facing. There is no such thing as discovering cancer too early!It is wonderful to take care of your loved ones. Please take care of yourself too. Right away. Wish you all the best!
Plus_Particular3366,"Yeah I was having job issues too when my dad was diagnosed with cancer. Realized nobody cares they’ll replace you in a second at work. Forget that company you’ll find better, believe it. Best wishes for your family and dad 🤍"
Loosey191,"Sorry if this is a stupid question, but when you said you're being replaced and you are losing your job, does that literally mean your employment is ending (as in you're laid off, fired, or you quit)? EDIT: deleted question that was answered elsewhere in thread. I'm sorry you're going through such a painful time."
Substantial_Host1849,I say put a timeline on it. Whatever their doctors can do. Then get it extended when it’s close to ending. Had a few accommodations work out for me by going that route.
Rebellious_Munchkin,"My comment assumes you’re in a western industrialized country, but I see this as the culture placing more value on nuclear family (having kids) over caregiving for older family members.

Less-Raspberry8031,"My husband lost his job when I was first diagnosed, he had proof I was sick and they didn't care. He missed 8 days in a year, and 5 of those were from the birth of our daughter they promised paternity leave for and didn't give. Then my gallbladded removed 2 weeks after birth and a few months later we find stage 3 cancer. 🙃"
Archpotatooo,"It’s been1.5 years for me, I am so glad work has been going well for you, and I completely understand feeling lifeless, I had dreams to go study more and it all crushed when I was diagnosed, after surviving it am having hard time w it’s side effects, it sucks. I feel lifeless as well and it’s so frustrating and I also have to pretend to be happy. I hope you know you’re not alone 🫂"
CoffeeB4Talkie,"You're not alone. I think what you're feeling is very common. I hope you find something that helps you find peace with what you've been through. I survived cancer twice. Two different cancers. I finished treatment for the first one in 2015, and finished treatment the second time in 2020. I also try hard to be normal and pretend that everything is okay....knowing the truth is I haven't been okay in a very long while. I'm still suffering the consequences of treatment, even right now. So I totally get it."
Available-Ad6731,"I have used dark humour since I got diagnosed. It is an acquired taste. I can’t use it with my parents. The ones that got it the most were other patients. There’s a movie called 50/50. It’s been around for a long time now. But the banter between the three guys when they are doing the one-day recliner visit, made me think of all the ways we used to come up with the darkest of humour to help handle the shit you’re going through. I remember writing on the front of my day diary, ""To laugh in the face of adversity, is the best laugh of all"". Sometimes it works, other times you just have to white knuckle it, till you come out the other end."
theSearch4Truth,"Dark humor is my cope too. Sometimes I'll say ""that joke was so bad it gave me cancer aGAIN"" to my buddy and I'll just crack up with a genuine, hearty guffaw. Can't do much about being a cancer survivor, but you can certainly laugh at it!"
PooojaMangal,"3 years to me too, cancer does not come with a manual on when to get over it, it's completely normal to feel that you feel."
Cute_Truck5493,Thank you friend. I really hope there was indeed a manual to crack the code of my emotional rollercoaster every single day. I try to look at my patterns and pacify myself. I hope I find better healthier ways of dealing with these feelings.
Southern_Dragonfly57,10 year survivor here. Sending you a huge hug. I fell into a huge depression after going into remission and it took quite a while to come out of that.
Cute_Truck5493,I believe I'm amidst one mental breakdown everyday. It's a struggle and I'm glad you were able to come out of it. I take inspiration from you my friend.
HeartResearcher,"My degree is also in psychology but in research, not clinical practice. My area of specialization has been the influence of life events on emotional well-being. Everything you describe is understandable and normal. You faced death, and in such an encounter, a certain innocence or naiveté is lost. It is difficult if not impossible to go back to living life as before. Ultimately I think this is a good thing. I'm two years out and still battling other health issues, including long-term side effects, and it's beyond exhausting. During treatment, support is usually higher. Most people understand what's involved. After treatment, most people are unaware of the ongoing challenges, so it's a lonelier journey. All I can say is there is nothing wrong with you. Keep going... there are some beautiful gems of love and wisdom hidden throughout the post-cancer journey. Whatever sadness or despair you experience, observe and learn what you can from it. You're not alone."
1LungWonder,"Does your psychologist understand post-cancer trauma and PTSD? Survivorship is a shit show.. I want you to know it's totally understandable and normal. Everyone around us expects us to be happy and positive and living every moment to its fullest, when in actuality getting up in the morning is a struggle. Finding people who understand can help, finding a support group or therapist who gets it is vital. I'm going on 19 years... I promise it does get better.. is it back to what it was pre-cancer? No, but it can be a good life despite all you've been through. Please be kind to yourself and give yourself grace... please feel free to reach out if you ever need a sympathetic ear. I'm happy to listen."
Silver_kitty,Strongly agreed. I would ask the hospital you were treated at if they have resources for therapists who specialize in post-cancer care
TheGreatSchnorkie,"So much of your post speaks to me! I’m nearly two years cancer free, and I have those dark moments, too. I always remind myself “hey, don’t kill yourself today. You can always change your mind and off yourself later, but there are no takesies backsies on this, so give yourself some time and see if you feel the same later.” I never do, and I’m glad I’m still around today. I’m glad you’re around today, too. The world needs people like us to support each other when we are on the proverbial struggle bus!"
Fun-Worldliness5772,Could not relate to you more - it’s such a mind f*ck being in remission and this hamster wheel of emotion! I’m glad you said something and aren’t holding it in - I do find posting in this community when I’m having these thoughts is such a nice outlet because it’s a safe space. The point of worrying your loved ones and putting on this fake and brave face is so relatable - I don’t have a solution here other than to just keep opening up about it and speaking your truth here in this safe environment 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
trimble24,"I can relate to this. Although I’m only just at the end of my treatment. I feel like I am supposed to be happy that I am a survivor, but I feel like my life is over now, and I am not the same person I was. Other stuff has been going on, it’s been a terrible year, so I’m now on antidepressants, seeing a mental health doctor tomorrow, and will be signing up for a Hope/Moving Forward course too. I’m trying so hard to be happy again. So i totally empathise with what you are going through."
Cute_Truck5493,I realize that with every year I feel more healed. This in no way means that life is back to pre-cancer era but trying to be happy is all we can do.
Agile-Baseball4305,"Yes, I get it. I am coming up on my 2 year post-treatment milestone and this may as well have been a page from my journal. The confusion of it all is enough to drive the sanest insane. What do you mean I spent three years fighting to stay alive, only to be granted life and no longer care for it? Statistically, I am a miracle (the many papers written on my case serve as depressing late-night reads) but every night when I get into bed, I still feel like I am in that hospital room writing notes to my family on the type of ""vibe"" I demand my funeral to have (LOL). Everyone expects me to be full of love and light, and while I can craft that exterior and slap on a smile for a few hours each day (well, some days), I feel entirely alone in the honest, vulnerable truth of it all. Recovery is hard. We will get there, my friend. Virtual hugs."
icyriverstream,"12 years survivor here. i feel you and i have been through this around the same time after my cure too. surviving cancer is a profound journey and it’s not unusual to feel the weight of it long after the treatment ends. it does get better, even if it doesn’t feel that way right now. i know this might not be of much help to you now because you don’t believe it, but you’re not alone in that boat. there are many of us in out here, rowing through the same storm, and we’re the lucky ones. please hold onto the hope that things will improve."
Proper_Procedure3285,"Yes. I’m so sorry you’re struggling. I firmly believe that navigating survivorship is tougher than treatment at times. I think I was in autopilot during that and now that I finally have the time to start processing what all I’ve been through. I don’t have much advice as resuming therapy is what has helped me, too. Please know you are not alone and your feelings are so valid. I hope things start to get better for you soon. Take care."
Fight_the_status_quo,"This is beyond normal. Survivor’s guilt sticks with all of us, and manifests differently in every person. I know it hits me the most when I lose a friend who was in seemingly good health. It always strikes me that, “I’m not supposed to be here, why did we lose them?” Do your best to think about what more you have to offer, and find a purpose to keep going. You’ve got this."
Cute_Truck5493,"Thank you! I'm trying! I am very ambitious and purposive in life. I continued my masters during chemotherapy and ended up being one of the top scorers. As I said, life has compensated for all that I've been through. I do not want guilt and fear to hold me back"
Lawmonger,"You need professional help. I have felt this way at times, but you don’t need to live this way. Get professional help."
HeartResearcher,"The fields of psychology and psychiatry have yet to discover a solution to human suffering, but what they are good at is helping people process difficult experiences. You know who else does this well? Peers who have had the same experience. OP is in the right place. There is no magic bullet."
Automatic-Station456,Yeah def in the same boat I’ve had AML plus a the BMT and I feel so unmotivated some times it’s an on going battle
Cute_Truck5493,It indeed is. I don't know how to detach cancer from every life choices that I make. I don't know if I can ever be 'normal'
Available-Ad6731,What’s AML/BMT?
Pyrheart,"4 years out and I get it so hard. I’m still relatively happy on an SSRI for PTSD and anxiety, it helps my depression too but then sometimes still the intrusive thoughts and yes at times s* ideation. Things that sometimes help: staying busy, THC, my girlfriends who have also experienced cancer/related trauma - honestly voicing these thoughts with someone who can relate/understand is IMO a healthy step. 🫂. Edit: just to share a bit, I was in the hospital alone for two weeks and it fucked me UP"
Cute_Truck5493,"Getting cancer somedays feels like stepping on chewing gum. I can't get it off my shoes and I roam around with it throughout the day. It's even on my mind at night. And sometimes this bastard enters my dreams in the form of flashbacks. I'm glad I have this community. Nobody, not even our close ones, can understand the side of cancer that we had to experience."
McDrewlius,"Yeah, I can see it going either way with the celebrating, especially what day is picked to commemorate. Personally i’ve been reflective and full of gratitude this week (Wednesday was a year from diagnosis), but I think when the ‘last med taken’ anniversary rolls around, I might try to get the gang together and have a barbecue and maybe blow out a candle.Either way, love your “celebrate anything and everything” vibe, you right! We been thru it, time for some good times :)"
GenerationExist,"I wouldn't celebrate my diagnosis date - ever. I note my surgery date, and the date of my last treatment: April 11."
Chatmal,"If you want to celebrate any of your dates, go for it! Celebrate life and second chances! If you don’t, that’s okay too. I posted similarly earlier this year approaching my first anniversary finishing chemo. It didn’t feel like a celebration but I felt I should mark the occasion, commemorate the day. I felt like I was supposed to do something so I asked in this group. I was a little surprised that a bunch of people don’t throw big parties or even small dinners. Sounded like too many of us have people in our lives that don’t like to be reminded that we had cancer. Or maybe that cancer exists? Who knows? Some mark the day with a little thing. Someone had a tattoo. Maybe I could plant a tree. I ended up with some expensive gluten free bakery items that I took pix of and ate. I never posted the pix though. It was kind of underwhelming commemoration, but tasty. I kind of had flashbacks to finishing chemo, ringing the bell, but then still being so exhausted for weeks longer. I looked more than ever like a cancer patient while waiting for my hair to grow in and praying for energy. I don’t even know the date of my next onc visit where my labs were good, NED. I could look that up because that might be a better date to remember. I think better for me was having a trip to plan for. A few months later, my cousin was getting married across the country and I definitely wanted to go. I got to dress up, figure out how to pack that, and see family I hadn’t seen in ages. I also brought a bunch of heirlooms to my aunt and she loved looking through photos and other goodies I brought her. My brother came with me and after three days of wedding fun, we spent another week doing tourist things around the state. That was probably more healing for me than anything!"
XPapiLotusX,We don't really have a huge celebration but I like to treat myself on the anniversary of my bone marrow transplant.
thebetternord,I celebrate my stem cells because they referred to it as my second birthday. And my remission day.
Rude_Butterfly_4587,Im 20y out from childhood cancer. We don't celebrate. Every few years or so I'll post on Facebook important anniversaries like 10y 15y and so on on the day of my last treatment. I would post the day we found out I was NED but no one knows what day that was lol. And I was diagnosed dec26 so christmas is going on at that point and yeah
McDrewlius,"Lol would be kind of a downer at Christmas I suppose. It’ll probably become less of a thing for me 20 years out as well, but this year had me thinking. Thank you for sharing!"
TrixnToo,"I dont celebrate really, i even have trouble with being called a survivor. I just recognize that this November 29th, it will be 2yrs that I graduated the survivorship program, made it to 5yrs post cancers, and they kicked me out of the oncology clinic, my dr said ""go away, i never wanna see you again!, now get lost!"" 😂 I was alone, walked to my car stunned, kinda felt like being dropped like a hot potato for real! Then nobody to even call to share my good news with. I just sat in the car and cried. I cried tears of joy, tears of relief, and strangely tears of grief! The oncology clinic at that point had been a main stay in my life for amost a decade! So yeah, November 29th is 2yrs, and i did keep the hospital bracelet from that day. All the other dates i think i made a point to forget, and there was no bell ringing or acknowledgment of my last treatment, not from anyone. the only date that i remember is april 17th, the day of my first chemo treatment, which was terrifying af! I wish i could forget that date, but its stuck in my mind prob forever."
McDrewlius,"I didn’t get a cool bell ringing thing either, was actually a little let down leaving the dr office that day! I remember wanting to hug a bunch of people there then realized that might be crossing a line lol so I just thanked them and headed on home. Seemed pretty anti-climatic. I definitely had some heavy emotions when I got home after that, and really for a while whenever I’d be alone it’d dominate my thoughts. Phew! So yeah. Thank you for sharing."
AvijeWitchyWoman,"3 dates i never need a reminder for: Dec. 12, 2020- The bleeding began & did not subside till week 3 of my External beam Radiation. Jan. 5, 2021- Confirmed Diagnosis via Biopsy; Cervical Cancer Staged at IIB, Lymph Node involvement shown on my PeT SCaN. Dec. 9, 2021- This day is and will be one of two most important that will ever happen to me; 1- My daughter being born(2011 ; and the morning my amazing radiation oncologist informed my husband and I that I had no evidence of Disease, or as we know it N.e.D.) I'm proud to stand with you wondrous humans.XoX"
Sketchylefty11,I celebrate cake day! On July 10th I rang the chemo Bell for the very last time. Now every year on that day I share a cake with my family. It doesn't matter what kind as long as it's cake!
eatdrinkNBmerry,"I had scans/blood work approximately six months after being in the hospital for a month for a stem cell transplant. I had my follow up scans and then an appointment with the doctor a couple of days later. That day happened to be 9/11/2001. I was on the train headed downtown to my doctor when it suddenly stopped. The city (Chicago) shut down as a result of the events that took place that day in New York. My nurse called me and said she couldn’t wait for a reschedule to tell me the good news that everything was negative. I’ve been celebrating that day ever since, even though it is bittersweet."
broccomole10,"I’m two years out and still kind of uncomfortable with the whole thing. I still cry a lot on the day they found the tumor, and I try to think positively about the 1st cancer free scan post chemo. I think it just feels like I’m massively jinxing myself if I let myself celebrate."
McDrewlius,"That’s totally understandable, cancer is scary enough as it is, no need to tempt fate, I get it. Hopefully in time it gets a little easier. My one year from diagnosis date is Aug 28, and i’ve been in a strange headspace all week thinking about what I was going through."
thefogdog,"Tbf I used to celebrate diagnosis day as it was the definitive date, but it was more celebrating how far removed I was from my diagnosis. I however haven't done anything for it for years now (24 years ago). Figured dwelling on the worst time of my life wasn't a good idea, mentally."
blackbird_11,"Honestly, I celebrate my bone marrow transplant as my second birthday and we go out to dinner and I get gifts! I also celebrate the day me and my family went into the hospital I got the transplant at, which is relevant since I was 9 when I was diagnosed/treated (they're 7 days apart so it's easy to celebrate). But I had AML so I'm not sure of your exact treatment. But either way, congratulations on your special day, no matter what/when you decide to make it about! 🥳"
Electronic-Ad-4000,The day I was cancer free
traveljunkie90,I’ve had this question too! 5 years later I don’t really have an answer. Ive never really “celebrated” but I’ve acknowledged each milestone. The anniversary of the day I was diagnosed I make sure to make a mental note of how far I’ve come since that day. The day i had a cancer free scan? Couldn’t tell you. Because I had another 3 months of treatments left. So I guess mostly the day I was done with treatments?? But it also happens to be the day before my husbands birthday-which he still says was the best gift ever.
McDrewlius,I like the idea of acknowledging and being grateful of all the milestones- someone on here said thinking about how far they have come through adversity- and celebrating the “end of treatments” day. My “home from hospital after 10 straight weeks” day is the day before Thanksgiving and I’m sure we’ll have a toast that night.
BunnyoftheDesert,"I had a temporary ileostomy during treatment and the only date I’ve “celebrated” is the day it was reversed- June 19th was a year! Otherwise, I’m with you, my diagnosis date was the worst day of my life. Recovery from treatment was brutal plus every three months when I have an MRI some new issue pops up...not cancer thankfully, but a problem caused by cancer. So you’re not alone with struggling to celebrate. Are you sure you want to celebrate? I’m ready for this time in my life to be a distant memory."
blackbeardshead,Just my birthday. Every day is a celebration.
1LungWonder,"I celebrate the day I had my surgery to have my lung removed. We call it ""Lungleavin' Day"" the day my lung left... We celebrate by writing our fears on a plate and smashing the plate in a bonfire. We started sharing the occasion with friends and family and it grew to become a really incredible celebration. We used it for a fundraiser for mesothelioma, the cancer I lost my lung to.. Up until the pandemic... 2020 was our last party.. My husband, son and I still smashed plates every year though.. We are going to start back up in 2025 again.. it feels like a good time to celebrate. February 2nd.. for most people its Groundhog's Day.. for us? It's Lungleavin Day :)"
McDrewlius,"I hope come February there’s a store sorely lacking in their shatter-able plate selection! Lungleavin’ day deserves a celebration!! Love the idea of shattering fears and plates, awesome."
fishcat51,"Yes I was actually reflecting on this today. I was also 22 and was reflecting on the fact that it’s been 2.5 years since cancer and I’m still not back to “normal”. Still haven’t recovered, still have many health problems, and no stable job. I sometimes forget my actual age because I’m mentally still stuck at 23. If I compare myself to my peers I definitely get upset. I did gain a lot of wisdom but unfortunately missed out on a lot of experiences"
alternativeanonacc,Totally relate
petra_reddit37,I just gave up. It's hard for me going every week or two when I can't see the people that I love the most. I haven't been at school for a year and I'm getting scared. Staying at home with the people I hate the most made me hate myself more than I have. Btw I suffered from lymphoma hodgkin. I will explain more about how I found out if anyone wants to know
alternativeanonacc,"It sucks absolutely, I know. You should make another post to share, that way more people will see and engage with you to share their experiences"
JFB-23,"Honestly, I’m just excited to still be alive. Whatever it takes to keep me here is a blessing, whether it feels like it or not."
fcancermama,"Absolutely. I was diagnosed the day before I gave birth to my firstborn. I had 2 friends pregnant at the same time as me and while they went on to have normal births I started chemo 3 weeks after mine was born. I was in and out the hospital for treatment/tests etc for her first year of life and I can’t get that back. 4 years later I had my son, having him put me into a prolonged PPD because I realized how much I truly missed with my daughter and was constantly reliving my firstborns traumatic birth and infancy. I’m 8 yrs cancer free and while it’s not as constant as initially, I still feel this way a lot."
alternativeanonacc,Hope you and your children are both well now. What bugs me is such experience are difficult to convey to anyone who have themselves not experienced it. Thank you for sharing
TheMadarchod,"I definitely think about this a lot because I got diagnosed with ewing sarcoma right after Junior year of high school and went through treatment during my Senior year. All of the plans I had with my friends for Senior year went right down the drain. Couldn’t go to my prom, couldn’t go on my senior trip. Thank God I was done with treatment in time for Graduation though."
alternativeanonacc,"I can understand, when I was under treatment I lost some friends too."
NoRegertsWolfDog,I don't get angry about time lost so much as what it took.
Delouest,"I was diagnosed in 2019 when I was 31. The day I went in for my mastectomy, my best friend got engaged. Another bought a house on my first chemo infusion. A friend finished her PhD program when I was in the ER with a fever from an infection during chemo. It goes on and on. And then my oncologist said I was allowed to go back to work, being around people and then literally that week the world shut down for covid. I don't think I have ""made up"" any time since my cancer diagnosis. I'm still single, can't have kids, can't afford to buy a home, same job. Except now I have medical debt and no boobs, so that should make finding a partner easier... anyway, yes I can relate!"
alternativeanonacc,"It sucks but thanks for sharing honestly, I relate so much to this that I don’t feel lonely after reading this with what I feel at times."
Secret779,"Yeah. I'm 19M, was diagnosed 3 days after my 18th birthday. I was too sick before diagnosis to continue A-Levels, but that school had me suicidal anyway. I was better off with cancer. But now I'm in a limbo post-treatment. I have no qualifications to go to uni, I'm desperate to move out of my parents' inaccessible home, I can't drive so I can't go anywhere, I'm having interview after interview to not be offered the job. I don't even know if I'd manage working with my continued fatigue and physical disabilities as a result of cancer. It's shit. My friends are at uni, going out, getting jobs..."
alternativeanonacc,"I know its easy for me to say but if you can maybe try and go back to finishing school or apply for diploma’s if you qualify. As you get back to these things life will feel so much in control however it may be. If you’re in remission, given your young age I am sure there is a lot to live for ahead. Now that I type this I realise it applies to me too."
apoohneicie,"Oh honey, if you only knew. For my first stage IV cancer in 2007, I had surgery and did chemo in one form or another for almost 4 years. Cancer free in 2011. For my second stage IV cancer, I did radiation then surgery and stayed in the hospital for 4 months in 2020 at the height of Covid so no visitors at all. Cancer free 2021. I want my early 30’s back!"
alternativeanonacc,"Getting diagnosed again after being in remission sounds so painful. When I think about it, terrifies me. How are you doing now?"
HailTheCrimsonKing,All the time. I have a little 2 year old and I think about all the time I lost with her while I was off getting chemo or in the hospital recovering from surgeries. Or even just all the appointments
tehgent,"If I knew then, what I know now, then, what bugs me more is that had I been married still to my ex wife when I was in the hospital, I'm 100% sure that by the time I would have gotten home post transplant, she would have already moved all my stuff out and moved in someone else."
Difficult-Scheme-265,"Your husband is someone who acted swiftly to get another job in order to feed/clothe/house YOUR family, educate YOUR kids, and cover YOUR medical bills (not your fault, of course; cancer is not only terrifying, it's terrifyingly expensive, but anyone with an ounce of humanity would willingly pay through the nose when life is at stake). Your husband is someone who -- in addition to freaking out about losing his job & possibly his wife -- has had to face reality, accept responsibility & do whatever is necessary to secure YOUR future. Your husband is NOT ""someone who probably doesn’t truly care about me"". Stop using cancer, cartography & your Denver's-dearth-of-decent-doctors nonsense as excuses & just admit you want to stay in CA for personal/selfish reasons. It's perfectly OK to want something. You're human. It's also OK tell your loved ones you want to live in California. It's not OK to tell your loved ones they need to live in a car because you want to live in CA & to hell with what they need (income, housing, security) if it means moving to CO. You're in this together. For better, for worse; for richer, for poorer; in sickness in California & in fiscal health in Denver; 'til your meddling ma departs. The needs of the many, and all that."
TrueTangerinePeel,"Maybe your husband can take the kids and move to CO while you find a small place to live to continue your treatment. Your family can help you with the cost. Once you recover, you can look for a job in CA and have your husband look for a job in CA as well."
rawbmeow,"Yes, sarcoma as well"
rawbmeow,Ewing sarcoma diagnosed at 32 when I was 26w pregnant. I'm 5 years NED
According-Town-1602,May I ask what kind of sarcoma?
rawbmeow,You can always fly into appointments.
rawbmeow,I'm in LA I'm treated at UCLA. My parents live in Encinitas
Snoo_30176,"I agree. One can never understand fully what they've never been through themselves. It doesn't mean we don't try to empathize. We're in San Diego metro area. I also know Sloan Kettering in NYC is also very good. Do you mind me asking what metro your in? I think I also read Mayo Clinic in Ohio. There's only a few metros we could realistically relocate to. A few hours from NYC could be a possibility, probably not immediately but I've been trying."
rawbmeow,I read your husbands post. I don't think he realizes the trauma we've been through.
Silver_kitty,"I’m so sorry you’re going through this. In general it’s definitely wild that he didn’t consult with you before making significant plans towards a career move like this. I think you need at least a session of couples therapy together. Him making these decisions single-handedly and you saying he doesn’t care about you point to things way bigger than your medical care. For the medical side though, I think you really should talk to your doctors and find out what they think. Depending on what you treatment/follow up looks like, it may or may not be reasonable to travel in for it. I was treated at Sloan Kettering in NY and chatting with other patients plenty of people flew in for their appointments. I think getting some more info from your doctors is really important here before you jump to any big decisions or feelings. No one here can really validate the difference in care, your doctors will know what the capabilities versus the other center near the new place would be or how reasonable flying for treatment or appointments will be."
OkCryptographer9906,"Does he work in a specialized field and have a skill set that may not translate just anywhere? I know that if I lost my job, we would almost definitely have to move, because finding another making similar money would be almost impossible here. Also, Colorado is a fairly short flight to California, and living expenses in Colorado are probably less, depending on what part of each state that you’re talking about. Why can’t you just fly back to see your doctors in CA when you need to? Even if it’s once per week, you’d probably still come out ahead vs. paying rent and utilities at both places. Sometimes we have to make compromises in life. This seems to be a fairly easy one for you to be able to make…. His may not be as easy."
ForeverNugu,Let's start with practicalities. You say your husband lost his job. How likely is it that he would be able to find another job locally that would be able to support the family and give you medical coverage to continue with your preferred providers?
According-Town-1602,There are jobs here but he would have to go on interviews and that would be work for him. He took the easiest way out because it’s a place he used to work at and quit.
According-Town-1602,Thank you for your thoughts. Means a lot. Going to try my best.
Pink_Castles,"The answer to both of your questions is no. I am so sorry he is putting you through this at an already stressful, to say the least, time. I am also sorry to say You should stay where you are. He is thinking of himself here and it sounds like this is the norm. You need to be where you are going to receive never ending support. Where you are comfortable with your oncologist and doctors. Put yourself first. Right now, you are what matters."
CFC1985,Let me get this straight...your husband lost his job so you have exactly $0 coming in at this point and he was able to find a job elsewhere so he can provide for his family? Sometimes in life we all have to do things out of necessity and it sounds like he is trying everything he can to provide for his family. They have qualified doctors in Colorado too so your best bet is to follow your husband to where he can best take care of you and that's in Colorado now.
According-Town-1602,The medical condition I have is very rare and I need the best medical team at this time and still healing from my second most recent surgery. And we’re not penniless at this time and he didn’t even try to find something here. That’s the point. His priorities are for his needs only and that is to escape to Colorado at any cost. He was watching a video on the bucket list of things to do in Colorado just yesterday. This is not just about him finding a job there. It’s about escaping and satisfying his personal desires. There a lot more to the story.
emorrigan,"I understand that you’re afraid to move during treatment- it’s a terrifying prospect. But sometimes life hands us really crappy circumstances, and this sounds like one of those times. Consider that your husband might also be terrified. He didn’t choose to get laid off, and he isn’t moving for fun- he’s moving in order to be able to keep you and your children housed, and to make sure you have insurance. The prospect of losing those things while you’re still in treatment must be absolutely terrifying for him. California is extremely expensive- just “any job” won’t cut it, both monetarily and insurance-wise. You’ve unfortunately got to be pragmatic here and go where the money and health insurance are. And even that isn’t the end of the line- my sister lives in Utah, and her insurance covered treatment in Texas. You and your husband need to work with his new company’s HR Department to see who your new health insurance provider will be, and then you can work with your current doctors as well as the new insurance provider to see if treatment will be covered. I’m sorry you’re in this situation- it sounds like a difficult one… but unfortunately at this point, you need to go where the money is. Your husband has found a way for your family to remain housed and insured. If his solution isn’t sufficient, you’ll need to find one of your own that is- as in, if you want to stay in CA, you will need money and insurance, so it will be up to you to find a job yourself."
[deleted],some feel different effects from these things its tricky
Electronic-Ad-4000,Yea everyone has a different experience even if it is the same cancer/treatment
No-Fondant-4719,Ok excuse me but what exactly is chemo brain? I’ve never heard of this
Cromhound,"I'd say chemo brain, but that's because everyone seems to think once chemotherapy has ended you are fine. But you'd know as well as I do that, that is not the case. Unfortunately my employer has been rather judgmental of my work since my return, and that's down to chemo brain."
apoohneicie,Chemo brain. Mine is permanent because of all my treatments. Making it really hard to get through college.
[deleted],"It sounds like we have the same dad, my dad has literally said those exact same things too lmao. I would rather die than go through chemotherapy again personally, but I also believe that the after effects are equally as shitty in their own way. I have survivors guilt, chemo brain and a few other long term side effects and I have very bad days sometimes. Cancer affects you for the rest of your life and anybody who has never had it will never truly understand our pain and trauma. I believe chemo itself and the after effects are both the absolute worst. I also stopped believing in god the day I was diagnosed. I will not worship a god that gives kids cancer. Don't listen to anybody who has never gone through it, I love my dad but I know for a fact that god was not with me during that hell."
Chatmal,"I’d say this is a pointless argument. It’s not a competition to see who’s worse off. He can’t fathom your experience and it doesn’t sound like he even tries to empathize. If he wants an argument, don’t bother. Lose any passion for this discussion with him and just react Meh. Or Nah. Be or act so spiritually advanced that he cannot comprehend. I probably would have credited science with my survival and not god. Lots of studies and sciencing had to happen to ensure more patients survived."
memyselfandXXY,"for me having two cancer diagnosis's and having a strong chemo regime in 2014 was horrible especially as they then said the chemo hasn't worked.. so I went through all the horrible effects of chemo for NOTHING. devastating to say the least, I later had surgery to remove the cancer. Chemotherapy affects my body health and mental health still to this day, chemo brain is horrible. but yes chemo and the whole surgery path etc was horrible too. Struggling with terrible memory loss and my cognition has declined massively. recently was referred to a memory clinic as it's that bad. oncologists have stated it's not chemo brain. so im like what is happening to me then? because its ruining me, I'm on 35 years old and can't remember what I did yesterday, forgetting to eat, shower, remember peoples names, getting lost whilst walking or driving, I write stuff down on sticky notes and its like my brain isn't recognising stuff. its very odd. :("
Pink_Castles,"I would take brain fog over chemo any day. Chemo was much worse for me. Chemotherapy treatment is different for each type of cancer (type of chemo, number of treatments or “rounds”, etc.) and person depending on the stage. People also differ in their reactions to chemotherapy (I.e., some have an easier time than others). I had an awful time. I had nine rounds of chemo and it damn near killed me. I explain chemo to those who don’t know as killing you to heal you. Everything in me died. I was like a newborn baby when it was finally over. I had no antibodies whatsoever and got sick all the time. I was so weak physically. It has taken me a decade to get “back to normal.”"
HabitHead1891,Chemo brain is real but to live is to resist. You can definitely improve. You can either give up or strive to improve. I almost cured my chemo brain using cold showers ( it works for me ). You always need to stimulate yourself. I agree with your father human is a living miracle. Every second there are trillions of chances of everything. I saw God at the hospital before I was not sure if it exists now I’m sure there’s God but not a human God.
NoRegertsWolfDog,"You want my honest answer? I'll take dying to cancer any day rather than going through chemo again. We all have different beliefs.. I respect. If it were me.. just agree with your father to disagree. He's happy his kid is alive. As someone who was considered ""cured"" more than a decade ago.. these ""side effects"" don't ever get better. I struggled through high school, and I struggle as an adult with my mind going blank, and in my case, I had to relearn how to.. well, pretty much do everything fro. talking, walking to fine motor skills, and I still randomly drop things as well. Sure.. chemo isn't at fault for this, but like I said, I'd rather die than go through that again.. I don't have the strength anymore. But you are alive. You have to reset your expectations of yourself. Find your new norm. Chemo brain sucks yeah.. you'll learn to adjust your life around it."
Electronic-Ad-4000,"Every time I try to agree to disagree he still wants to argue, damned if I do damned if I don't. I'd rather die than go through that again.. I don't have the strength anymore Relatable! But you are alive. You have to reset your expectations of yourself. Find your new norm. Chemo brain sucks yeah.. you'll learn to adjust your life around it. That's the thing... I don't wanna be alive but I don't exactly have a choice. I found my new self a couple months ago well I guess I still am and I'm learning my limits with a lot of things. Thx for the advice!"
jackofwind,"Your opinion is valid because it's subjective. Regardless of what the opinion is, your dad doesn't get to have valid because he's never gone through cancer or chemo. Frankly he can think what he wants but it's as worthless as if I had an opinion on the daily stress levels of an active pediatrician (which I am not, and do not have). Personally I'd rather be alive with chemo brain than dead from cancer, but they're not really comparable things becuase you can also beat cancer without getting chemo brain. Chemo brain doesn't happen to everyone, it varies in severity, and it's something that results only if the chemo actually works and you beat the cancer in the first place."
cooltapes,"Medicine healed the cancer but there are extended side effects. The mouth sores sucked the worst for me. Your dad sounds…fun. It gets better, I promise. (Symptom wise, not necessarily the parental part)"
die4dethklok616,"I had three rounds, with my third ending in July this year and surgery in September. While chemo brain was inconvenient, I didn't think it was that bad for me. Ocassional brain farts halfway through sentences where I'd completely blank out and forget what I was going to say or what we were even talking about did happen kinda frequently, but now, 3+ months after my last round, it's no longer happening to a noticeable degree. That said, other aspects of treatment and side effects were awful. My third round included high dose and stem cell transplant, the side effects of which I'd never want to experience again. Would I rather deal with cancer than go through further treatment? I'm not really sure how I'd answer if I was put in that situation again tbh."
Pink_Castles,Congratulations on finishing treatment!
0livesworld,How many rounds of chemo did you do? I had 5 rounds of chemotherapy for Hodgkins Lymphoma at 18 and personally don't struggle with chemo brain or any side effects but I know a lot of survivors do. Chemo is confusing and can be so different depending on the type of cancer being treated.
Educational_Back_637,"I am an adult who was diagnosed at 36 with Pleomorphic Rhabdomyosarcoma. It’s apparently super rare as an adult, but those who know my childlike nature find it ironic. I’ll hit 5 years in February so I guess that means I’m cured, but since they throw all the heavy treatments at it in adults and hope something works, I’m still nervous of it returning. I don’t feel cured.The tumor was in my right back muscles alongside my spine… “about the size of a package of Jimmy Dean sausage” according to my surgeons.They had to remove a good portion of spine to get clear margins, along with a ton of muscle tissues. Then I had to have tons of rods and bolts installed to support my spine. I’m mostly Cobalt from T-10 to my pelvis (screws are titanium). Safe to say my life has changed due to being differently able now. I get too tired still, which makes my right leg start skipping and nearly dragging due to nerve damage. All this said and I still struggle with survivor’s guilt. Why did the woman with my same diagnosis in her ankle not survive? She was younger, had a toddler and one on the way… so much life and new life left to enjoy. Why am I in the small statistic of adult survivors of this? Maybe it will come back and I’ll hate the world again. I am not religious. Far from it. I just have major anxiety and depression prior to cancer. The PTSD my kids and husband have from all the mountains we’ve had to climb the last 5 years…it still lingers, but I do feel more like myself most days. Recent lupus diagnosis so we shall see where the tides of life carry me…"
cllittlewood,"I am late to comment, but I did a Reddit search to see if there is anyone else out there like me (42 F). I too have never met another adult survivor of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. I am a survivor of Stage IIB (intermediate risk) embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma of the soft palate- mets to my tonsils. I was 15 yo at the time of my diagnosis in 1997 and was treated at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. I’ve struggled with survivors guilt as well… still do. I wonder where the friends that I made would be today. One way that I’ve helped myself find peace and accept what I cannot change is by participating in research studies when they present to me. I’ve struggled with chronic health conditions that are a result of the chemo and XRT that I received, as well as secondary cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, age 35). My genetic testing did not reveal a genetic mutation that would predispose me to cancer. I lost my Mother to ovarian cancer when she was 49. Given my personal and family history my oncologist treats me as if I do have a mutation. Skin checks, colonoscopy before the regular recommended age. He has a low threshold for imaging or labs if something is off. Wishing OP and others affected by cancer continued good health."
Leading_Cheetah_9644,"My daughter was diagnosed with stage 4 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma at age 6. She’s now 10. She had Mets to her bone, lymph nodes, back, adrenal gland and was also in her muscle. She’s currently NED and been in remission for almost 3 years!"
omicron-theta,I’m so happy and inspired to hear that. I wish to hear more stories like this. Our daughter was diagnosed with stage 3 ARMS just before her 9th birthday. We have been in treatment for a year now and she will be 11 soon. Doing a clinical trial at St Jude’s now with a drug called Onivyde . What treatment worked best for your daughter?
jibil,How old where you when you were diagnosed?
serendipity5309,11
CokeNSalsa,Late to this post. I survived stage IV Rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder at age two. It’s now been about 30 years since I finished treatments.
BlacksmithArtistic87,Late to this post but I was diagnosed with stage 3 alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma in 2014. 60 weeks of treatment including an awful 6 weeks of radiation and have been free of disease since
EStVM,"My original diagnosis in '88 was rhabdo, which would have given me a <1% survival at six months based on its location in my gut. Turns out that diagnosis was wrong; NIH determined I had a rare form of non-Hodgkins Lymphoma. I still had a rough time with it, and it was a ""bad year"" at the Lombardi Cancer Center at Georgetown. I made it out, most others didn't. I have not met another childhood survivor who's my age, which is lonely. Skip ahead and I'm now 40 years old in an intensive outpatient therapy program just beginning to really process my survivor's guilt. It's common. It's okay to feel it. But it's really important you find some help processing it. I've done a tremendous job masking it, but I've been a mess in one way or another for the past 34 years. Big hugs and I'm glad you're part of the survivors club."
AyushAgarwal4,"Well I survived it..Had Embryonal Rhabdomyosarcoma when i was 5 or 6 years old.(1993-94) Rt Ear. 30 years later and after many Recurrances and half the Rt ear gone, still alive. Don't know why."
AGoofycat,"Sorry, I'm not a survivor of that kind of cancer. I am a survivor of 4 different kinds of cancer. It is hard when people die from cancer and I am still living. I will never understand it. The one thing that keeps me going is being grateful each day I am alive to be with my family, friends, and pets. I am glad you are a survivor. Prayers!"
CokeNSalsa,"Wow, which four types of cancer did you have?"
24rawvibes,Get out of here!? Me freaking to my friend!! Took my left testical at 8 years old! Left me with a fair amount of trauma to be honest. I wasn’t one for going for surgery or chemos without a fight to say the least. Is this a rare form or something? Never looked to much into the specifics to be honest but always prided myself in knowing the name. Pleasure to meet you
ReallyAwkwardRabbit,"My son's left testicle was removed due to Rhabdo. He was only 2 so he doesn't remember at all too much, and he was quite relaxed about port access and medical procedures. We also did every Thursdays for chemo! Have you had any physical post treatment side effects at all? Sorry you've struggled with the PTSD. I remember saying to my husband it would be so hard to go through around 7-8 years old."
serendipity5309,Definitely rare as I don’t know many survivors of it- I hope you’re well.
AStarrb,"The basic life tasks. Meals, cleaning, laundry, grocery shopping etc. You’re a great friend! Good luck to your friend!"
kellenanne,"The best thing my friend did for me was drop everything and be at my side. When I was brain fogged or overwhelmed and couldn't deal with daily tasks, she stepped up and did them without saying a word. At that point, we'd been friends for 11 or 12 years. Now, after she stood by me during cancer treatment like that, I know we got a lifetime of friendship ahead of us. Big gestures are great. But it's the little daily things that will be the hardest. Rides to appointments. Get easy food to have around. There will be days when your friend may not want to move from their spot on the chair/in their chair/etc - make up a small basket of snacks, lotion, water bottle, any meds, whatever might be needed or appreciated to have on an end table close by. When someone anticipated a need and addressed it before I knew I needed it made me feel so. very. loved."

AGoofycat,Just being there for your friend is the best gift you can give her.
skyeri,"Try a 'pamper pack' unscented moisturiser for the dry skin many people get with chemo, ginger tea for nausea, special shampoo for hair loss/scalp irritation, activities to do while receiving infusions (crosswords, colouring etc) blanket to take to the hospital, new drink bottle- things like that"
Chatmal,"Kudos for asking and wanting to help your friend through this! -Cards of love and encouragement are nice. Celebrate the end of chemo or other milestones. -Depending on her home support, easy to eat snacks or meals. Stuff that requires minimal preparation. I like things like yogurt, cheese sticks and cut veggies. -Brain fog can get bad. Encourage other caregivers to take over certain tasks for a while like bill paying or sort the medical records and bills that come in. I brought an extra brain & driver with me to all of my dr appts for a while. Some I recorded on my phone so I didn’t forget what the dr said. Rides? Or maybe you can pick up her Rxes for her. Fairly quickly, the immune system drops, so help keep her away from unnecessary public places. If you’re seeing her frequently, do your best to wear a mask in public, get your flu shot and Covid booster (new one at the end of this month) to help protect her. Comfy pjs or loungewear might be good. I was soooo tired so I spent a lot of time in my pjs and I love cute pjs! (I had abdominal surgery so I needed very loose or soft waistbands, my oldest pj pants were the best!) -If you can spend time with her, just being nearby to chat with or not, if she’s tired. You can help her shop for chemo hats if she’s going to lose her hair. I found really cute lace slouchy hats that I really like and made me feel feminine on Amazon. If she likes tea, interesting flavors might be appreciated. I’ve got cherry berry, blackberry and some others I really like. I don’t even heat water (for now)! I’m doing cold infusion in my fridge to keep up hydration. -One of my friends texted me every few days to check on me and I so appreciated it! She works in health, so I told her about everything! I figured she wouldn’t be scared off. It is weird that we feel the need to make our friends & family comfortable with our diagnoses. The treatments can be really rough with surgery, chemo, radiation, repeated bloodwork and scans. Don’t make her feel she has to make you comfortable. It’s okay to acknowledge this can be hard."
Friendly_Animator_81,"Hello everyone, can you get noise canceling headphones without the bar going across the head? My friend will be undergoing radiotherapy for brain cancer so I’m assuming (again please let me know if I’m wrong and/or mistaken) her head will be sore xxx"
SeeminglySusan,The gifts I appreciated the most were things that made it easier on my husband and I like home-cooked meals and a cleaning service. I agree with the suggestion for noise cancelling head phones. Infusion rooms are SO loud. I can still hear all the beeping lol
Friendly_Animator_81,"Thank you so much guys I’m writing all this down, I really appreciate all help and advice xxx"
cowaterdog73,"Oh man, anything that shows you care! That is so huge! Basically everyone forgot about me when I went through my year of chemo (which is very common). It would have meant so much to hear “I love you and I’m here for you no matter what” You are a WONDERFUL friend!!!!"
Friendly_Animator_81,"I don’t feel like a wonderful friend at all, I feel utterly helpless but I’m trying my best 😢 xxx"
EStVM,"To quote John Green, ""don't just do something, stand there!"" I.e., sometimes the best thing to do is to just be there. That said, if you see a need, go ahead and address it rather than asking ""what do you need?"" Sometimes just answering a question can be exhausting, especially with chemo brain."
Wonderwoman_420,Hats and scarves. Noise cancelling headphones for chemo infusion days so she can go inward while she’s stuck there getting chemo. Books or audio books that are escapist. I read every single novel by Elin Hildebrand — they’re all family dramas set on and around Nantucket Island. A really good travel mug (glass with silicon lid is my fave as insulated metal holds taste) so she can always have a warm cup of tea on the go? A new nighty or slippers. Sunscreen as she’ll be sun sensitive. You are such a good friend. Good on you.
Wonderwoman_420,Just want to say the noise cancelling headphones were my absolute saviour when I was admitted too. Many chemo patients u fortunately do eventually have to be admitted to hospital due to neutropenia.
microsoftgirl24,"Nope, after treatment and surgery were over. Everyone dropped me like a hot potato and like to pretend it never happened."
Dead_Man_Sqwakin,"I was seventeen at the time in 1982-83. I had no feelings about it, my family didn't discuss it (they aren't good with feelings) and I just pushed through it. After it was done, I tried to go back to normal life and act as if nothing happened. Apparently, it messed up my brain and I did poorly my first year in college. I had been training to be a doctor my entire life and here I was, practically failing easy science classes. I didn't know what to do and no one thought about counseling back then, so I drifted through school and life for years. I've been fairly successful, materially speaking, but I've now find myself fighting the late term effects. My blood pressure is all over the place, I was rendered infertile by the chemo and didn't want to adopt, so I have no children. I've been diagnosed with Borderline as a result of the trauma (not certain about that) I'll need a new heart valve soon, and Ritalin is the only thing that keeps both the fatigue and the depression at bay. There have been days when I've considered suicide, even though my after effects pale in comparison to what some on this sub have confessed to. I had an excellent therapist, but moved recently and had to give her up. Good therapists and support groups are hard to find, since you really have to experience cancer to understand."
Ok_Perspective2865,"I'm not sure if I should say this, but I will anyway. Your story is hard to read, so I can't even imagine what it must be like actually living it. Are you in a position now where you no longer consider suicide? Especially since you had to stop seeing your therapist? Don't they so virtual sessions? Would you have any advice for people who would still like to help and support those affected by cancer, but haven't experienced it themselves?"
skyeri,"I found ending treatment in many ways harder than treatment itself. I'd had so many people watching over me every 2 weeks throughout chemo that it then felt wrong to not be going to the doctor constantly. And then the anxiety that comes with every follow up appointment, scan etc is terrifying, and as someone who is on the younger end of cancer survivors I just felt like I'd failed at something. I do have a work mate though who is also a young survivor and talking to her really helped me feel heard throughout that time"
Ok_Perspective2865,"I am glad to hear that you have someone to support you. Would you say that the transition back into life immediately post treatment could be managed better by the medical system, in terms of psychological support?"
kellenanne,"Once my treatment was done and I was declared NED, everyone around me expected things to be normal again. I could have Big Emotions when I was in treatment but the minute it was over, that wasn't allowed anymore. ""You're good now! It's over! You can get back to your normal life!"""
Ok_Perspective2865,That's sounds so jarring. How did you cope? Were there other services available to you that might have helped? A general theme in this thread seems to be that friends and family aren't generally reliable.
peachsqueeze66,"This is such a good question and one that I don't think gets asked enough. I feel as if I am always waiting for the other shoe to drop. I was in ""maintenance"" for 15 months, so I had the illusion of safety. Every three weeks someone saw blood results. So SUPPOSEDLY if anything was really crazy someone would be alerted. Right? Um, not exactly I don't think. I paid FAR more attention to those numbers than anyone else. And every single time I asked questions I got ""I don't know"". WHY? Why don't you know? Jesus! They still have no answers to my questions. So now, I am only to be seen every three months, and that is ONLY because what I had was SO RARE that I am able to INSIST on that. It is terrifying. That is only from the medical perspective. Personally, I feel like my son thinks I am invincible. No matter how many times I have told him that my cancer can (really, honestly may) come back, he gets into the weeds about the TYPE of cancer and WHERE it was found and it turns into a whole conversation about how I am ""Fine"" now. HE feels confident. Oh, okay then. My stepchildren act like nothing ever happened. So weird. My husband. Wow. What to say there. He is 15 years older than I am and the cancer is a loop that we were certainly thrown for. He misses his wife. I have no patience. I have no libido. I honestly want to be alone. He was/has been/will continue to be great about the diagnosis and prognosis. He will go to the end of the earth. But I am 100% certain he is in the ""aren't we done with this shit"" camp. He just wants our old life back. Me too buddy... me too..."
Ok_Perspective2865,"It sounds as though you are frustrated that no one else seems to share the gravity of your experience? It's so scary not knowing when or if you get ""that call"" again. Would doing anything in particular make you feel more prepared or even feel a little bit in control?"
CoffeeB4Talkie,"Honestly, I had cancer twice. I finished my last treatment the week of Christmas/New Year of 2020. I'm still messed up about it. I feel that people who know my story just say ""well you're alive!"". And I am. I'm grateful for that. But being a survivor does not come without consequence(s).... and I have a lot of them. Then there's the constant doctors appointments and scans. Then I feel like I have my family that use my story as THEIR story for pity.. so I feel like I can't even be vocal about my bad days and feel what and how I truly feel.. because certain people make it about them. I've always said that watching your love one suffer can't be easy, so I get it. But I bury my feelings because I can't take other people's reactions to my issues. It stresses me out even more. It's a vicious cycle. Then my co workers with the smart comments whenever I have a doctors appointment.. like ""again?! when are you going to be done?"" Um.. as soon as I die.. because these ailments/side effects don't go away. But thank you for asking, I guess."
Marsoupilami777,"Same Here! Had cancer twice and had to do stem cell transplant. And Ive lost quite a few ""friends""...Especially those with the ""You're Always Sick"" and the ""Youre never at work"" (in a reproachful manner, meaning to say that I dont work as hard as them). The Menopause (or rather POF) didnt help either (the extreme fatigue, insomnia, depression etc). When youre 33 suddenly you feel so alone with no one to relate to. Even a 15 plus year friend suddenly just unfriended me, because she wants to enjoy and live life and my problems did not fit with her current lifestyle. I have started taking hormones for a Month and it has extremely improved a lot of things and im glad I dont have those people in my life anymore. During those 3 hard years, I tried to get back to normal, not knowing that I could never have that ""normal"" again and accept the ""new tired me"". But the new tired me has showed me how much some people are only there for you when you are at your best and when they have no more advantages to gain out of the relationship, they cast you aside. ""Just exercise, you'll feel better"" ""You are so lucky to have life, some people dont have that chance"" ""You should take some vitamin D"" ""Why are you always sick?"""
Ok_Perspective2865,I'm sorry to hear this. The level of ignorance and insensitivity baffles me. How do you cope? Especially since it doesn't seem as though there's anyone in your social circle or family you can talk to?
edog5150,Well now your cancers over get back out n be normal says everyone who's never had cancer.
Wonderwoman_420,"Finding work that was supportive of still having so many medical appointments. Marriage issues due to ongoing treatment side effects (zoladex + anastrozole = no sex drive & vaginal atrophy). Mental health challenges (medical menopause = mood swings, depression, low stress resilience)."
Ok_Perspective2865,"Thank you for sharing, Wonderwoman. It sounds sounds like you have been through alot. I wonder if I have permission to be curious, and ask how you coped?"
cowaterdog73,"It’s was rough. My wife and I had a lot of trouble. Almost 2 years of me being sick, scared, anger, non-functional genitals, extreme anxiety, no support system (we had just moved out of state 3 months before diagnosis), and my job let me go, so we ended up broke, financially stressed, and thankfully on Medicaid (which was great insurance by the way !). It was difficult for us to find “us” again. We were guided by a therapist to write down our honest reflections of the experience and share / process them. It was a long hard (HARD!) time, but we both came out of the process feeling connected again. Believe it or not, I hadn’t realized how much she struggled too. Admittedly, I was just surviving, but I hadn’t realized how much trauma she felt too. There was so much we didn’t understand about each other’s experience. Things were tentative for a while, and we kinda had to re-learn each other because we both have been changed. I’m just now starting to try and work again. I had a job early in my recovery, but the panic attacks and numerous dr appointments made it awkward and untenable. I know I say this every time it comes up, but therapy is very helpful during transition."
Ok_Perspective2865,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. It's wonderful to hear that you both found therapy useful! Was that covered by Medicaid? I wish you the best in your transition back to work.
[deleted],"I had anxiety before cancer so I have some experience of managing it in my daily life (including medication, narrative therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy). I have terrible ""scanxiety"" when going for scans and tests ."
kiriakiam,It’s relapse paranoia I deal with it every day I feel phantom pain in places where I had tumors and it spirals me into paranoia
CoffeeB4Talkie,"IDK if it's accurate.... but I think of it as PTSD. I'm always worried/overwhelmed about it. I survived twice (two different cancers) and I'm always scared as shit that I will have to go through that shit again. Sometimes I get so frustrated with people around me telling me that I'm good because I survived... yeah I did. But clearly I don't have a good track record health wise. And I survived, but look at the side effects I have to deal with. It's A LOT. I appreciate the positivity, but sometimes it pisses me right off."
[deleted],"I agree, my dad truly believes that since I've been in remission for so long now that it's never going to come back and I just look at him and say nothing. There's always a chance it could and I live with that fear everyday, I do appreciate his reassurance but it's just a fear I'm going to live with the rest of my life. My tumor was in my stomach and I had really bad stomach pain before I was diagnosed with cancer and now everytime my stomach hurts I think it's a tumor and I hate it. Living with constant paranoia is not fun. I'm very sorry to hear about your cancers too, I genuinely hope you stay cancer free for life now"
SVBPLPHP,"Funny, because I broke down and started crying 2 days before I relapsed, on my way to work, and I started saying to myself ""why me, why did I survive and other kids that I knew died"" (1st diagnosed at 19 ALL and relapsed at 26). I never had that fear of my cancer coming back. Now that I has come back, I live in constant anxiety and depression."
[deleted],"I'm so sorry to hear that. No one deserves this god awful diease. I hope everything works out good for you and hey, I wonder why I survived too. Every other kid I knew has died and it's the saddest thing, just know that your not alone my friend. I wish you the best of luck"
bakedapps,I’ve always called it health anxiety
[deleted],I like that
Fucktheglobalistz,congratulations! may I asked what kind of treatment did you use? Thank you
SNAP-HER,I had surgery which took out 100% of the tumor then radiation therapy and chemo in pill form called Temadar.
[deleted],Amazing!!
Mr_Spunspn,"Wow......way2go!!!! Im dedicating the next set of clouds to your remarkable recovery......can we celebrate together naked, maybe??!!??"
SNAP-HER,I doubt we can celebrate together naked. I bet youre no where close to where I live even if I wanted to. 🤷‍♀️
serendipity5309,All the best to you!!!
17voltaire89,Congratulations and here’s to continuing the survival journey. Stage 4 renal cancer with metastases into lungs and lymph nodes here. 3.5 years but it’s becoming a struggle now. Just started oxygen at night. Stories such as yours help me in the dark times that we all visit occasionally. Like. Right. Now. I wish you so much continued success and happiness.
SNAP-HER,Thank you so much. Stay strong.
Three-m1440,That is wonderful happy for you. May you continue to live long and prosper. Hugs and love.
SNAP-HER,Thanks. 🖖

AGoofycat,Happy for you that you beat the odds for survival. Enjoy your life to the fullest!!!
loveisblind38,Here’s to seeing 100!!
highlandadder,I had a complete opposite experience. Barely got needed care after cancer. I didn't realize this was a thing.
adventure_pup,"It’s not just parents-children, although my mom does still struggle with it. I went through treatment at 27&28, ended about 2 years ago, and my husband and I are still dealing with tiny remnants of moving out of the caretaker/caregiver roles and back to being two healthy people in a marriage. Therapy for both of us has really helped but I agree, there needs to be more discussion around it for everyone."
Inevitable_Cheez-It,what is “NEC”? haven’t heard that acronym before
adventure_pup,Assuming it’s “No Evidence of Cancer”? Much like no evidence of disease?
ExpensiveDust5,"I finished my ALL treatment when I turned 17, so didn't get that as much, but I do know what you mean. There really isn't anything you can do, short of making it a legal matter, which I don't think would be a good idea considering your age. No matter how old you get, no matter how healthy you are, all they will ever see is that sick kid in the hospital bed. This is the reason why I do not tell people about my past until I absolutely need to, because it changes the way people look at me, and I hate it when people feel sorry for me. My best suggestion is: just ride it out a couple more years, but if at all possible, move as soon as you graduate/turn 18/etc. Just get away from them. Parents don't understand that the empathy they still hold from you being sick is just as toxic as being in an abusive family."
not_irrelevant_,"Dang, that's disappointing , but thank you so much for the advice - I'll probably end up doing exactly this. Also, it really sucks that you had to go through this too, on top of all the cancer trauma, hope you're doing better on all fronts now."
cooltapes,I don't know if this is a cancer survivor thing or if your mom is kinda just an overbearing parent. My recommendation as an adult who does not have children (so take it with that)...approach the situation in a mature manner and talk to your mom about how you'd like to be treated.
Electronic-Ad-4000,"The same thing is happening to me (also 17) but with my great grandma. She's constantly asking me if I ate and what I ate. Then when I tell her I already ate she argues that I didn't because she didn't see me eat. She sleeps all day so by the time she's getting up I'm going to sleep so how the hell does she know if I ate or not. She's always saying I need to eat healthier in case the cancer comes back. Who in their right mind would say that to a cancer survivor. And the thing is I do eat healthy but sometimes I'll eat snacks after a meal or get a pizza for dinner. And even when I go out with my Dad she'll say it's cold out there I need a jacket or it's too hot to be outside today. I LOOK AT THE WEATHER EVERY SINGLE TIME BEFORE I LEAVE THE HOUSE, I PLAN MY OUTFITS ACCORDING TO THE WEATHER. She never goes outside so she doesn't even know how it feels out there. It's gotten to the point that I don't even talk to her anymore, I ignore her now because I can't stand her opinions. My Dad has told her multiple times that she's too pushy and needs to stop telling me what to do because I can take care of myself. Everyday my Dad will ask me how I'm feeling and if I ate which I don't mind because he's not pushy with it. He doesn't argue with me on it like my great grandma does and the only reason he asks me if I ate is because he'll get me something from the store if I didn't. Anyways I'm moving out very soon because I can't stand the way she treats me, you should move out too if it's affecting your mental health."
not_irrelevant_,"Oml, this is pretty much copy paste exactly what I'm experiencing, and I agree; It's infuriating and beyond frustrating. I really hope moving out makes things better for you, I'll definitely consider doing the same, thank you for the advice."
RJuarezYuen,"My dad did this once I was diagnosed and a few years afterwards. I'm the eldest of the 3 of us - and prior to being diagnosed at 14, I was told I was the example to the other 2. But post diagnosed, my dad always told my siblings to do things for me. After I was in remission, it had irritated me, especially as I was becoming an adult. Fast forward to now, being 33, it has pretty much leveled off. However, in the workplace, I have generally stayed quiet about my past health issues, just so people will think of me with my merits and not my sickness. Only recently, have I been more open about it and made it clear, I made it to where I was because of my hard work and only to tell them of my health issues if something were to happen to me."
Fangsofthenorth,Try talking with her about it. I've had to have this talk with my parents and my boyfriend that all because I had cancer doesn't mean I'll shatter instantly.
ExpensiveDust5,"Good luck, I have days where I literally cannot think, and have been off treatment since 2001. Methotrexate and Daunorubicin were what I was on from 95-01."
witchynapper,I have the same problem and haven’t had chemo since 2013. Have always wondered about this… like my memory is abominable and I get the worst brain fog all the time
madwetsquirrel,"I’m a registered sleep tech. (So of course I’m gonna see this as a sleep issue, but…) It’s possible you have some type of sleep disturbance, which absolutely affects our memory. The additional joint pain and stiffness might point to other reasons, but definitely add a HST, home sleep test to your list to figure it out. Incidentally, you can have very poor sleep and NOT snore or even feel like you slept through the night."
memyselfandXXY,I sleep like a baby. so it's not sleep related. :/
Electronic-Ad-4000,Maybe you have chemo brain.
memyselfandXXY,even 10 years later?
yuh_hoe,"im scared that im gonna feel like this, i was 16 when i was diagnosed with hodgkin’s lymphoma im 17 now at my last stage of chemo therapy and to be honest the risk of getting it 5 years later scares me especially at the fact that im just gonna do all this all over again,question how long did it take for your hair to grow back feeling ugly is the worse"
Electronic-Ad-4000,The thought of getting it again scares me too. You should look into therapy or support groups. Hopefully everything works out for you! If you wanna talk you can pm me I'd be happy to listen.
Knitting_Octopus3791,"Every word of your post, except for your age, is something I might have written ten years ago. I (now 33F) was diagnosed with stage 3 Hodgkins at 22. I went into remission at 23. Fortunately, I've been cancer free since then and have gone on to have a great life after cancer. After I learned I was in remission, I felt sad and lost for a long time. I thought I ""should"" be happy to be alive and cancer-free, but like you said, nothing was normal, and day-to-day living felt just weird. Plus I had a lot of angst about what I was doing with my life and struggling to envision the future. All those feelings caught me by surprise because here I was cancer free, just like I wanted to be, and why couldn't I enjoy it? For me, though, there were valuable things that came out all the soul-searching I did during that really tough time. Before my diagnosis, I was positive I wanted to pursue a particular career that I was super excited about, and I'd just started on a big new chapter. During my treatment I decided to leave that field, though I had no idea what to do instead. After a few aimless years of not really wanting to do anything, I eventually settled on my current career, which I love and which is absolutely a better fit for me. Therapy helped me. Also giving myself lots of emotional space to feel my feelings without judging them. But I think for me what helped the most was just the passage of time, accumulating more and more life experiences, and getting to live a life that I love. Somewhere along the line, cancer went from being this behemoth that defined everything to being a part of my past that was awful but shaped who I became afterward. (Not that it's 100% in the past--there are still medical and emotional effects--but it feels more like a thing of the past than a thing of the present.) And today I am grateful beyond words that I beat cancer, though it took a long time before I genuinely felt that way. I'm afraid I sound like I'm romanticizing cancer--I'm not. The whole thing sucks beyond suckiness. It's not that I'm glad I had it, but I am glad about some of the choices I made afterward. And I'm very, very glad I ended up alive and where I am--much as I wish I could have gotten here in a different way. Anyway, I'm saying all this in the hopes that hearing from someone who made it to the other side can help you believe that you're not doomed to feel this way forever. (Also in the hopes that you're actually still reading this--sorry I'm a bit late to discover this sub and see your post.) Take care of yourself and hang in there."
Electronic-Ad-4000,"Wow it's nice to know there's someone out there that was in my exact situation and made it out to be happy. Thank you for the advice it really helps. Lately I've just been here, not happy or sad just here and I don't wanna go to therapy because those people won't understand since they've never had cancer so I've been in cancer support groups which help a little bit. Everyone around me is happy I beat cancer and keeps congratulating me which is very annoying. I hate when people do that or even bring it up, I wish people would forget about it. I feel like a completely different person, my mindset has changed, my body has changed, nothing about is the same which is fine. But anyways thank you for responding 😊"
catslay_4,"Your “old self” doesn’t exist after a cancer diagnosis, but that’s okay. I love the me after my cancer diagnosis much more. It’s been 9 years for me and I was 26 when I was diagnosed. I still have appointments, scans, I get anxious from time to time, and I will always have to worry about taking care of myself and being diligent in a more proactive way than others. However, I am so proud of what I’ve went through and come out on the other side from. I understand how valuable life is and the feeling of it potentially being taken away. I live more presently, smile more often, and even though I sweat the small stuff, I don’t like I used to. It’s going to take time, in fact, it’s going to take years until cancer begins to move to the back burner for you. For me, there’s certain parts of who I am that started to feel normal again with time, and there were aspects of me that were different. It’s a balance, one that you will figure out with time. Just remember, take it day by day. You’ve come out the other side of something absolutely life altering. It is so beyond feeling lucky to have survived, it’s about grieving what you lost because of the disease, accepting the change that your life on the other side will undergo, but you have the freedom and right to feel any way you want and all of these feelings are completely justifiable. I promise you, all of us have felt them at some point or another!"
Electronic-Ad-4000,"Everything that you said makes so much sense, you become a different person after almost dying. I too understand how valuable life is and how fast it can be taken away. I see the world differently now. I'm glad you're doing better 💜"
TrixnToo,"It's going to take a few years to build up strength and also to adjust to things that changed permanently from having had cancer. That includes mentally. Everyone treats you different, be respectful, but create your boundaries with those around you of what you will and won't tolerate. To this day there are certain foods, words, things, practices that I don't want around me because it reminds me of my chemo days. Those who know about them, need to respect this. I've got some family and friends that act shocked if the topic comes up, as if they just rather erase a painful life altering time in my life like it didn't happen at all. I'm like, yeah, it did happen, I lived through it remember? To simplify, if it's helpful to you, keep it, if it's not, scrap it. That includes people lol"
Electronic-Ad-4000,Yes it'll take a long time to feel back normal again which I'm sad about because I want to be a firefighter and I know that'll hold me back. I've cut a lot of people outta my life from that time. It's just the people I live with that don't understand it's hard for me to talk about that period in my life so they constantly bring it up. I'll be setting boundaries soon though.
alliesouth,Yeaaa it took me like 4 years to feel like myself again on the inside. I couldn't fake it but I didn't feel normal for a couple years.
Electronic-Ad-4000,Thank you for responding to my post because now I know I'm not the only one feeling like this lol
[deleted],"It takes time! I was 15 when I was diagnosed (same cancer), 16 when I finished treatment, and I didn’t feel “normal-ish” until about 19. My Dr told me: Damage to our bodies is easy to do, and it happens very quickly. Recovery is harder, and it’s slow. So give yourself twice as long to heal as the time it took to do the damage… or more! It gets better, I promise you!"
Electronic-Ad-4000,Thank you those are some very wise words
yackiesoba23,"I was 17 when I was diagnosed with stage 2 HL. I’m 30 now it took some time but just try to focus on being your age, spending time with family and friends, find a few hobbies/interests and doing things that you enjoy. You will get there 😻 feel free to reach out if you want to chat more!"
Electronic-Ad-4000,I have new hobbies now so that's a start.
Sensitive_Physics794,"Yes, just because you are cancer free doesn’t mean life goes back to the way it was. The treatments can be intense and a lot of time people lose muscle mass and energy. This may be your new normal or your body may still be healing. You are still young and your body has a higher ability to heal since your young. What symptoms do you have?"
Electronic-Ad-4000,"I don't think anything be will back normal again, I'm currently writing a book about it actually. My symptoms are: My voice has changed it's more scratchy. My toe nails are black my finger nails are back to it's normal color. I'm in constant pain all over my body. My chest hurts where I had surgery (port placement) so I can't wear bras anymore . The worst of it all is the chemo brain, I had to stop studying to become a firefighter because I can't remember anything and can't focus on things for long. And I'm sure I'm missing more but that's all I can't think of right now"
analogtendency,"Totally normal. The physiological part of cancer is one thing, and the psychological another. It does get easier to manage as you get more familiar with your triggers and sensitivities, but at the end of the day, it’s something you’ll always have to manage and work through. You got this, and the rest of us are here to help when you feel like you don’t."
Electronic-Ad-4000,"Every cancer survivor knows that when you're physical free you're not mentally and emotionally free. One of the hardest things I'm dealing with right now is my great grandma, she keeps bringing up my cancer anytime she gets. Constantly talking about how it was so hard on me and how my family abandoned me during that time. It's like she's purposely reminding me about the most traumatic experience in my life so that's definitely a trigger. Thank you stranger 💜"
JMies93,Can I ask what your tumour looked like prior to biopsy?
Tabbycatmomof3,"I can send you a photo of it privately if you’d like. I can’t for the life of me figure out how to share it on this thread or even this reply (Reddit noobie honestly) but to describe it it was literally like a bit of my tongue bulged out on the side of my tongue. It was way different than my previous biopsies of oral lichenplanus that I had (flat white patches) this was skin colored (same color as my tongue so muscle colored???) but irritated coloring like red around the edge. It was not hard but definitely had “mass” to it if that made sense. I couldn’t push it in like a sack of liquid. It was oval in shape and very smooth looking edges I didn’t think much of it till my ent said that cancer can actually be painful and hurt some people don’t realize. At the time it didn’t hurt when she said it but a few days prior to the removal and biopsy it grew incredibly painful at times. I couldn’t talk, I couldn’t eat it would get excruciating. I was hoping that it was a placebo of anxiety of dealing with this different looking spot on my tongue and thinking the worst case scenario but it turns out the pain was real and it had its reason as to why."
twoscooop,"I had soft tissue cancer as a child and for 3 or 4 years after remission I made the fact I had cancer my identity. I loved all the attention I had gotten during treatment that I feel like I lost a lot of who I was to become the ""cancer kid"". It took a lot of self reflection and a lot of getting over myself. For a long time after that I wouldn't talk about my experience unless someone else brought it up. But almost 20 years later and now I just talk about it casually if it comes up in conversation. I don't bring up any of the darker stuff unless people specifically ask. Ultimately you are a ""survivor"", but what that means is up to you, but I promise it gets much less awkward talking about and much easier to joke about. Hope I could help a bit, good luck."
Tabbycatmomof3,The joke part I’m already at. A coworker who knew what had happened told me to watch my tongue over a cheeky comment I had made to him I smiled and said “don’t worry I already am.” And he realizes what he had said and apologized. I told him to not feel bad because I found the opportunity perfect and it made me smile
Kockamamie,"When I was 18 I found a lump coming up from under my collar bone. Had it removed and biopsied and confirmed lymphoma, later staged at stage 1. I had 6 rounds of chemo hell and 15 radiation sessions. When I was diagnosed they told me if I had to pick a cancer to get I picked the best one. I still feel weird saying I’m a cancer survivor because I feel like I got off easy compared to what so many others went through."
luxconstellata,"I feel the exact same way - I'm an HL survivor and I have always felt guilty because (relative to other things), it was easy to treat. Even at 14 I did my research and I wasn't that worried about surviving. It's hard not to feel that way when other people go through much worse under the same umbrella term of ""cancer""."
Electronic-Ad-4000,"I was diagnosed with hodgkins lymphoma last year, I'm now cancer free and my doctors said the same thing. ""If there's any cancer to get it would be this one because it's curable"" I've since hated that people say it's the ""good cancer"" because there's no such thing as a good cancer, cancer all around is bad. I don't even feel like I'm cancer free, I'm still in pain and nothing is back to how it used to be before I got sick."
jebbybean,In 2015 i had a terrible stomach ache. Within a few days they found a 7cm tumor on my liver and i had surgery to remove it with clean margins. I was also suddenly a cancer survivor not knowing how long i had cancer. Oncologist said chemo and radiation for post liver surgeries in cancer to keep the tumor from coming back/make left over tumors disappear usually doesnt happen and the side effects are heavy so i opted out of it. No one was happy. Nonetheless im now an 8 year cancer survivor who also feels weird about the title. I have no actual help but you can message me if u need an ear
Rude_Butterfly_4587,"I had squamous cell carcinoma at age 6 in the roof of my mouth. My ordeal only lasted about 6months total due to radiation treatments, a few chemos, and like 3 surgeries to remove the cancer. Although my issues lasted longer I get what you're saying I hear people that had to battle 2+ years and it makes me feel bad. But make no mistake we still drew the short straw, just maybe ours was a millimeter longer 🫠"
FrogsAndBlueberries,"I don't have any solid advice necessarily, but wanted to say I know what you mean and thought I'd give some insight into how I've learned to handle the thought of being a 'survivor' (mainly thanks to my therapist!!): I had Hodgkin's Lymphoma back in 2020, when I was 23 years old, so it's still kind of fresh. At no point was I told, nor did I ever really think, that death was a possibility. It was just half a year of chemo then a lot of recovery. The chances of it coming back are very slim. I still feel weird about the word 'survivor', as well as the thought of having 'beaten cancer'. All I did was turn up to hospital every 2 weeks so that doctors could put a bunch of chemicals into my body. What I've learned over the last few years, however, is that there's different ways of 'surviving'. Sure, death wasn't ever on the horizon for me, but I what DID survive was the mental, physical and emotional stresses that the whole experience puts you through. It completely shakes up your world and how you view life, and all of that has the potential to crush you. It absolutely messed with my mental health as well, and god knows I'm still working through it, but I'm here! I haven't let the cancer beat me completely, because I'm still here, and I'm somewhat okay! So, when the idea of being a 'survivor' comes up, that's how I figure it out in my mind."
[deleted],"Also a Hodgkins Lymphoma survivor here (she 15 at diagnosis) and I feel weird about being a survivor, I feel like for a LONG time during and after chemo it defined who I was. The very definition of my existing was either cancer patient or cancer survivor. I’m about to be 32 and I’ve spent more years of my living life as a survivor than the 15 years before the cancer… and it kind of makes me mad. I don’t talk about it much anymore because there’s not much of a need to and I want my life to be defined by who I am in my soul, not on a cellular level. Hey y’all, none of us are alone! Cancer puts us in weird mental places, and that ok! 🫶"
Electronic-Ad-4000,"I had hodgkins lymphoma at age 17 (last year) and the whole time I didn't process that any day could be my last. Everyone says I'm strong but I'm not all I did was stay alive which is what people do everyone. So I don't see how I'm special. I don't even feel like an survivor because nothing has really changed. I'm still in pain, I'm still weak. Everything has changed. Nothing is how it used to be before I got sick."
PlateParking7647,"I just spoke to a friend yesterday about a new project looking for survivors sharing their stories of survival for the International Childhood Cancer Survivors’ Week. And she said the same thing. She didn't feel like a survivor because she ""only"" had a surgery to remove her tumour. My response is, there's no ""gotta be this high to ride the ride"". Someone else has always had it worse, but it doesn't diminish your own experience. As for the guilt, it's something I've experienced myself, especially when struggling mentally with suicidal thoughts in the past. No good advice on this one except saying that survival isn't easy, it's just the first step and those who did die, would they have lived, would probably have struggled same as we have. We always want more."
ExpensiveDust5,"21 years ""cured"" from ALL, and all I can say is it took me a long time to really get a grasp of who I was, what I can do, and where I fit in to the world. Still not fully there, but I found what I enjoy doing the most is helping everyone I possibly can with whatever the situation they are in. That has landed me many different jobs, mechanic, security, demolition, and currently head of Maintenance for a beach rental company. Everyone struggles with ""what is my purpose in life"" and I feel that is even harder for a cancer survivor, because we have gone through so much more than most people, and learned more than most people ever will. I finished my treatment at 18 years old, but never really felt like I needed a companion in life until I met my wife at 30. You'll find your place, just be patient. It doesn't always just fall into place, but it will come to you eventually. That being said, put yourself out there. And my biggest advice I can give is: Don't make your entire life about cancer and how you survived. Yes, use it as fuel for motivating you to push harder, but IMHO, when talking to people, or applying for a job, if you open with ""I'm a cancer Survivor"" the first reaction normal people have is pity. That is why most people I meet either never know I survived cancer, or they find out WAY later on."

CowRaptorCatLady,"Hay 34 now was diagnosed at 26, I get how your feeling cancer put so much of my life on hold and possibly not having kids is the worse all my friends moved on had babies have their lives I feel left behind sometimes. It's a horrible feeling but at th same time not much I can do about it so live on I go."
[deleted],"I was diagnosed at 17. Next month marks 40 years for me. I too figured I wouldn't last long. They told me I might get 15-20 years. Here's some advice: Don't measure yourself by others. You have experienced a trauma that they haven't. You're also experiencing an ongoing trauma that is especially impacting given your age. More and more is being learned about the physical and mental late term effects. Depending on your location, there are resources to help, especially if you're a childhood survivor. Many ""Children's"" hospitals have programs specifically for survivors of all ages. I'm fortunate to have access to one. Many of the teaching hospitals also have programs. I struggle with after effects also. My psychiatrist daignosed me with Borderline Personality Disorder due to the trauma. (A good psychiatrist can help.) I've also been told I'll need a new heart valve soon on top of the four stents I have. And occasionally I feel like I've wasted too much time trying to be ""normal.' I've had a succesful career, but I can't have children and didn't want to adopt because the idea of possibly dying with a young child didn't appeal to me. But I digress. If you'd like, you can send me a message and I'll be happy to find the resources you need. Actually that goes for anyone on this sub. If you need an advocate to help you find what you need, PM me."
highlandadder,"Thank you so much for your comment! I actually see a survivors clinic at Emory in Atlanta, unfortunately there seems to be a lot they cannot help with. It seems to be too late to actually improve a lot of the after effects, as there was a long time I didn't receive services. At least they say the mental impairments or whatever you'd like to call them won't get worse. I've met other survivors who don't know about survivors clinics though and I hope they see this and can find one!"
Beginning_Permit_546,"There isn’t a lot of research or help/ guidance to help with survivorship. I feel like no one wants to help you once you are in remission. The trauma and after effect we feel , we have to learn to deal with it on our own."
chronicmeeper,"Hey I’m also 26, diagnosed at 2 and today is my 19th survivor day. It is really really weird to come this far, with all we know being the after. Some people don’t get how hard it can be physically and mentally to just get through the day to day. I’m proud of you for still being here. And I get the bittersweetness of it all. Almost like we’re nostalgic for a life we didn’t get to live? I hate that you feel this way, but it’s good to know that I’m not alone in these feelings"
[deleted],Survivors guilt can be horrible. I didn’t think about it too much growing up but sometimes I can’t get it out of my head. Sometimes I get depressed and wonder if the world would be significantly different if I never made it. I’d love to talk with people that understand this better. That’s one of the reasons why I’m glad I found this sub.
CoffeeB4Talkie,Congrats on 21 years of remission. You are not alone in your feelings.
[deleted],Your feelings are valid. Well said.
[deleted],"You’re not alone in feeling like this! I’m about to turn a weird corner for myself and it’s a happy-sad feeling: I was 15 when I was diagnosed, and I’m about to round 16 years remission which means I’ll have spent more of my life as a cancer survivor than I ever spent as a normal kid. It’s like when women get married and someday have had their married last name longer than their maiden last name? I think it becomes more difficult to remember what life was like NOT as a survivor with every passing year. And it’s a weird ass feeling… grateful to be here, dealing with long term effects, frustrated with knowing I’ve been held back in certain aspects yet overwhelmed with pride at how far I’ve come at the same time. Bag of mixed nuts!! Salty nuts at that… You’re not alone!"
highlandadder,"I feel for people who remember a ""before"". I know it must be difficult. I don't have much of a before but it really hurts to hear my mom talk about me being a happy and bright toddler like I don't have a future now or that I'm suvh a bummer."
apoohneicie,Just being a survivor makes me feel strange. I have an imposter syndrome on overdrive.
PabloPaco99,Thank you for your post.
imagirlfromnc,"I do..I wear the pink ribbon on my right shoulder....for my mom. She had 3 different cancers during her life. I miss her,but the ribbon reminds me to be strong like she was. I am a cancer survivor also...."
[deleted],I’m sorry for your loss but I’m glad that you’re doing okay. My situation was weird. Nobody else in my family ever had cancer. They know which chromosomes or whatever we’re messed up but they never knew why.
Spaggie11565,"I'm planning on getting 3 ribbons: pink at the top (breast cancer), blue and purple under that, side by side and slightly smaller (arthritis & fibromyalgia). Thinking about something going around and/or through the ribbons, but not sure. Still in the planning stages."

WorryStoner,"I heavily considered it after my official remission, but I realized it would be a permanent reminder to me and a permanent question that literally everyone can ask me about ( if visible). I had skin cancer, so I opted for a different design but In my head I know it's meant to ""reclaim"" the skin that tried to kill me lol"
apoohneicie,I thought about it but now I’m saving up to get a little chibi Deadpool riding a watercolor phoenix.
kittenstarr84,I have a pink ribbon on my wrist and alive written above it.
WombatHat42,"Yes. Got a half sleeve one, orange also(for leukemia - APL specifically) The end of the ribbon starts at the shoulder and wraps around the arm with a few loops(forming the cancer ribbon part). I added the quote that was on the wall of the room I did chemo in on one side and a skull on the under side of the arm with the ribbon going through the eye sockets. Id like to make it a full sleeve but don’t know what to do. Then I’ve got the date of diagnosis at the bottom…12-24-07"

McDrewlius,"I’m in my last couple weeks of treatment from APL. 42 year old male, in Glendale CA. It has sucked, but I guess it always could have been worse.Got diagnosed late last August 2023 after a blood pressure test was 181/something which led me to my Dr ordering blood tests, to find my blood levels basically zeroed out. Started blood transfusions immediately, had 1st bone marrow biopsy, week later confirmed diagnosis, had a port put in within a week of that, which gave me a massive hematoma around my chest and neck (on account of the zero platelets) that took about 2 weeks to get down to where they could try to access it. I went from feeling no symptoms the first week to barely being able to make it to the toilet after a few days once it hit.When they had trouble accessing the port (after several days of both blood transfusions and platelets) I was admitted to the hospital. I’m in Glendale, CA, and the LA Cancer Network is in the Glendale Adventist Hospital. My first stay was 5 weeks. I was getting blood and platelets every other day like clockwork, and after a couple days it overwhelmed the staff I guess and they shipped me to ICU. I had begun ATRA and it infiltrated my lungs and I was really struggling to breathe and was put on a max flow breather (the thing in the nostrils, but this was about as thick as a snorkel). I was so bruisey that my whole right arm turned purple from the blood pressure checks. At some point my port stopped working and they decided to try an “adjustment” which was brutally painful- think the surgeon cutting me open and manhandling around the port to try to “unkink” it. Felt like Andre the Giant was playing a Ouija board on my chest. I blew 3 blood vessels in my eyes from the strain from that. That was not fun. In ICU, Had my only week long round of chemo (Idarubacin) that I surprisingly handled okay, more and more blood bags and platelets… after about 2 weeks my white blood cell count started coming down (it had skyrocketed with the ATRA) and my lungs kinda settled and I left ICU. Started the standard 5 atra pills in morning/5 at night along with the mon-friday arsenic IV’s. Seemed to be stabilizing. Had my 2nd Bone Marrow Biopsy to see if I was in remission. Dr’s were optimistic, was discharged after 5 weeks.Was home for a day, Dr got my results (in remission! Yay) told me to go home and enjoy a week off from treatment (it’s about mid October now). Next day I feel awful, have a 104 degree fever, borderline convulsing from the chills annnnnnd back to the ER. Made it 2 days in public. Super depressing. Takes about a week of antibiotics (Vankomyacyin) before they decide my port is the culprit for my sickness, so they remove it. Then I don’t get better, still feverish all the time (this is about 2 weeks into the second stay) and my lungs and chest cavity start filling with infection/fluid. I get a tube put into my lung, and I have an abscess on my liver that’s driving the infection, and a tube gets put into that too. 2 tubes coming out my right ribs draining pink snot for over 2 weeks, infection goes down. Haven’t been getting any treatment for the cancer the whole second stint in the hospital. After 2 weeks of the tubes im my ribs (worst stint of the whole saga, but I did get introduced to morphine here) i get them removed. I get 2nd port put in the day before i’m discharged, the day before Thanksgiving. 10 weeks and 3 days of hospitalization total. Generally speaking it’s been standard treatment after that. 4 cycles of 1 month on, one month off of mon-friday arsenic infusions, and 7 cycles of 2 weeks on 2 weeks off of ATRA. I have found the ATRA to be far more of a grind than the arsenic- gives me headaches, i sleep awful, and just feel kinda feverish the majority of the time.I have one more week of Arsenic infusions and ATRA, then two weeks off, then 2 more weeks of ATRA, and i’m DONE.Haven’t ever typed everything out like this before, and…good lord it’s a novel."
Different-Use-5185,"I’m a bit late to this party as only just found this. I was in my early 30s in 2016 when I got a DVT in my left leg. Was on blood thinners for 2 months and then I just felt really fatigued and needed to have a coughing fit every time I walked any more than 50 metres. Went to my GP who tested my oxygen levels and they showed me at 72%. Sent me to hospital and stayed overnight for tests scans, etc expecting pneumonia or severe chest infection complicated by blood clot on my lung in the worst case scenario. Ended up not leaving the hospital again until 5 weeks later. Had the arsenic trioxide and ATRA combo but to make it worse I had the dreaded ATRA syndrome and went into ICU. At my time of discharge I had suffered viral pneumonia, swine flu, collapsed lung from pulmonary edema and embolism. Left the hospital with fungal pneumonia and still requiring chemo and ATRA but feeling a little better. Had a total of 63 bouts of arsenic trioxide in the end over the next 9 months and then in remission only requiring bone marrow aspiration every 6 months. It’s been 8 years and I now have mild ptsd (I go into sweats and shaking when I hear IV machines and smell cheap acidic bathroom cleaner) and now have lymphoedema and post thrombic syndromein my left leg (where the DVT occurred) but fell extremely fortunate and happy to be alive."
WombatHat42,"I believe I have post thrombic syndrome as well but in both legs (worse in the right). Probably the only real, noticeable side affect from the whole experience. At least that I can tell. Out of curiosity, did they ever tell you what they thought caused it? They told me the cause was unknown but could be from exposure to certain chemicals like benzine and stuff in farming sprays(I guess a lot of farmers get APL)"
TranslatorOk5071,"Hi! I’m a survivor of this awful disease, 5 years in remission now. I have also had ADHD since I was a toddler"
WombatHat42,"I didn’t start noticing more effects of my adhd until my mid 20s. Idk if it was due to chemo, my football concussions or that I’ve always had it. Out of curiosity what was your treatment protocol? Curious how similar it was to mine"
Intelligent_Arm_7348,"I just had APL go into remission. I know exactly how you feel man, it's like walking on egg shells and it can bring on lots of anxiety. My treatment was 28 days of chemo, you know the arsenic and 8 pills a day. Migrains, fevers, weight loss, hair loss, you name it. Luckily I had some valium left over I took some and omg I felt peace again for the first time since before this... I don't know what causes APL, but the chances of it coming back are very slim. (or it coming back as a more aggressive form, also very slim chances). I was so relieved to hear this...i WILL say, I was vaping a ton, and was using neutrogena sunscreen, the one that causes leukemia, even APL for Years. If you have any questions or anything feel free to reach out."
WombatHat42,"Congrats on being in remission! How did they find out you had it? For me it was cuz I kept getting blood clots. How long ago did you finish treatment? Did you do chemo and arsenic or just arsenic? Cuz arsenic was a newer part of the therapy(by which I mean it had been around maybe 5-10years at that point so they called it new). What’s the treatment plan now? Checkups every year? For me chemo sucked, arsenic not so bad but damn ATRA pills are what killed me though. Iirc my oncologist said there were studies suggesting just arsenic was equally successful. Which when I was diagnosed it was around 80% remission rate and considered a cure after 3 years(most leukemia I guess is 5years). I never knew about the sunscreen stuff but the docs up at Mayo said though they don’t know they think benzene is a culprit. Which is common in fertilizer and though I’m not a farmer I live in the Midwest so I’m usually only a mile or less from a farm and that spray carries pretty far. Always cleaning it off my windshields in the fall. They wanted to give me Valium when I was in the hospital but I refused to admit I was depressed or had anxiety. I wish cuz if nothing else, I’d have it now for when I fly haha"
zeerorequiem,"Never had APL, but I did have ALL. I totally relate on the cognitive effects tho. I was still in school so of course the work was easier than university, but I just feel like now i’m sooo out of my depth all the time. I can never remember anything, always struggle to think of the correct words and just constantly feel “scattered” lol. I sometimes wonder if I have ADD, and definitely feel it’s only hit me after treatment :/ I’m 7 years out of a BMT and honestly this is the worst i’ve ever felt mentally. No idea what’s brought it on, but every time I go for checkups I end up in the bathroom crying and my whole day is ruined lol. I keep struggling with “enjoying life” because every moment I have to spend doing something I don’t enjoy (like work), I feel .. guilty I guess ?? It’s hard to pin-point the emotion, but I just always feel like what’s the point in having gone through all of that to spend half my life being miserable in a job lol. I’ve lurked on posts of people with similar experiences and the consensus looks like therapy is the answer but for the life of me I can’t bring myself to talk about how I feel irl :/ I’m also prone to writing novels 😆 but I hope you’re doing ok !! and wishing you good health :)"
Ok-Exercise3477,"I had Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia and was diagnosed a few weeks before my 9th birthday. I finished chemotherapy in June of 2010 when I was 11 years old. I'll be 24 in about a month and a half. High school was very difficult for me and it's gotten harder for me to focus as the years have gone on. I didn't go to college and I still don't want to because I know I would just be miserable and stressed all the time. It makes me feel like a failure in life. I do work a full time job as a custodian (but it can be physically taxing sometimes because of the physical after effects, particularly fatigue and low blood pressure issues) and I share an apartment with my boyfriend. I have depression and anxiety, and I'm on the autism spectrum so I'm in therapy for multiple reasons and it does help when you've got a good therapist. I'm very grateful for all the great experiences I've had in the last 14 years of remission, but it's hard being a survivor sometimes."
WombatHat42,"I definitely get the scattered or can’t think of the right word thing. I also will say one word when I mean another. Especially when im stressed. I will be talking about A but my brain is thinking about B and every now and then I will switch a word that is related to B and say that instead lol I also had several concussions from football though so maybe some of it is long term side effects from those. Therapy is probably the right answer but like you I can’t bring myself to talk about it. I’ve always been more bury my feelings. As far as enjoying life, find little things you enjoy and make time for them. Schedule an hour every couple days to do what you want. I recently switched fields from pharmacy to IT because of the stress and not having to deal with the BS and people in general has made things so much better haha While I was still in school I decided to do study abroad as a way of a reward(used my financial aid). Felt I’ve got the chance and just went thru this shit why the hell not? So used my financial aid to study some of my premed courses in England, did neuroscience research in Taiwan and spent a year studying Russian in Russia. And travelled a ton in between. Now that I have a better paying job and have the income, I plan to start traveling again. My goal is to reach every continent, visit as much of Europe/EU as I can and get to Australia. I can’t take my money with me so why not spend it. And should my APL ever come back I figure this way I’ve done something I wanted to do."
[deleted],You might find more people with APL in r/leukemia. I had AML. I later got meningitis during my treatment and some of my doctors think that lead to my cognitive impairment. What’s weird is I don’t remember a life without post-cancer checkups. It’s weird having nostalgia for the hospital.
ExpensiveDust5,"Chemo brain, phantom pains, dizziness, feel weak, sometimes I have to fight just to get the strength to get out of bed sometimes, and my ""cure"" date was March 2001, 22 years ago. (39M with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia, or that's what it was called in 1995) I got the ""3 years of hell"" from 11-14. There are days when I feel like I'm walking on air, and can move easily, then there's days when I feel like I have to turn it up to 200% just to be ""normal"" and it's hard, super hard. I've learned to just power through the hard days, and hope the next day will be better. The phantom pains can be extremely painful sometimes, to the point where they bring me to my knees, mainly in my front thighs where I got Methotrexate-7 shots in each leg, twice a month for the 3 years, and chest pains where my Hickman catheter was for 6 years! Sometimes my spine hurts in my lower back around where I got my twice a week Spinal taps. I probably have blood sugar issues because diabetes runs on both sides of my family, but I never get checked or check it myself, nor do I check my blood pressure. One thing I hope they warned you about was the possibility of bone density loss, and the increased chance of your teeth decaying earlier than normal. Mine look like I'm a meth addict (never done drugs, so not the case). Make sure to go to the dentist FREQUENTLY, or your teeth won't last! I come from a poor family, and was never successful enough to go to the dentist."
PlateParking7647,"Got sick 2003, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma at age 15. Still have many of the issues since then, many similar to yours. I've attended many conferences for survivors and patient advocates and it's common in survivors attending to have similar issues. But, it's also shown in studies (finally getting more and more of these). Many factors will affect what late complications you may experience, age being one, but also treatment, sex and diagnosis. There's a plethora of studies showing this with some complications having higher risk when treatment was initiated at a lower age and some other at a higher one. This is a good summary though: https://www.cancer.gov/types/childhood-cancers/late-effects-pdq I don't know your treatment schedule but I know ALL and non-Hodgkin's had a similar one. I got Asparaginase, Methotrexate (IV I believe), intrathecal and tablets, Vincristine. Probably more but I can't remember. Anyway, don't take my word this as I don't know your schedule. Still, many of the issues that you're experiencing are listed in this literature as well as in other places. And I can't remember the last time I had boundless energy either 🤣"
WombatHat42,It has been just over 15 years and the only thing I still deal with is a severe leg rash. But that is from the DVTs I got due to the cancer. I had acute promyelocytic leukemia that initially presented with DVTs. Nothing really helps the itching either(think a mosquito bite on top of poison ivy on top of chicken pox that had poison oak smeared on) Oh and my hair color changed lol
paniwise,I still don’t have the energy I had pre surgery and I’m almost 4 years out. I’ve started to just accept that it’s always going to be like this- another challenge to face! That sounds hopeless but I don’t mean it in a cynical way. Just trying to process it all and keep moving.
witchynapper,"Had leukemia in 2010 when I was 10. I have endometriosis, experience very frequent fatigue, anxiety, high blood pressure, frequent stomach pain, hair loss (was diagnosed with alopecia), raynauds in hands and feet."
Wide-Violinist6722,"I had AML chemo only in 2012-13. I am mostly fine most of the time, and I consider myself very lucky. Over the past decade I have felt that something is off -- definitely still have chemo brain, and sometimes, fatigue and low blood pressure/fast heart rate. I've only recently realized that some of this might be related to chemo. I have a really difficult time finding information about this, and it's hard to know who to ask since oncologists are so busy and also especially re leukemia, very acute in their attentions. If anyone has ideas about where to get info about long term symptoms and survivorship, I hope you'll add that!!"
Wide-Violinist6722,"Oh, just to add -- yes, dizziness, shakiness, fatigue. But is this chemo? Or am I just getting older and as a result collecting issues. I'm 40F, just fyi."
eav830,"I'm a 23F who had neuroblastoma at the age of 2 and have dealt with chronic stomach issues my whole life. I had chemo and radiation to the abdomen. I dealt with a lot of stomach pain directly after treatment that they did exploratory surgery with and never found answers. I think even when we are ""cured"", cancer survivors still carry symptoms with them for years afterwards"
[deleted],"I don't mean to be depressing, but many pf them never go away. In my case, they showed up well after I finished treatment. I had chemo and radiation back in the 80s. If you've had mantle radation you need a good cardiologist, and if you've had any radiotherapy at all, you need to watch your thyroid. Chronic fatigue is a part of it that I struggle with. I also have high blood pressure, four heart stents, a faulty valve and my muscles don't metabolize energy correctly. I aslo don't sleep well. Other than that, I'm doing okay."
Ok-Exercise3477,I'm so thankful I didn't have to go through radiation. Those two years of chemotherapy have definitely left me with problems though.
AshtonPowell5,I was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia when I was 14 in 2014 and finished chemo 6 years ago. I still have chronic nerve pain that the chemo has caused. I still get regular chemo brain. My low blood pressure use to be pretty bad but last year was when it got better. I still have problems with fatigue and motivation but I think that’s because of my depression and anxiety that my cancer journey gave me. I have trouble breathing sometimes where I have to take big breaths in. From the chemo and for laying around too much through my cancer journey I developed drop foot. It’s because of that I physically can’t run properly. My ankles and wrists are still very weak from chemo also.
AshtonPowell5,"During my treatment I developed allergies for platlets, Morphine, fentanyl and Ambisome."
Ok-Exercise3477,Adding down hear that I'm also allergic to sunscreen. I wasn't allergic pre-cancer so that's a pretty weird one. And the other weird side effect that I'm very grateful for - I rarely get mosquito bites. My blood probably tastes terrible to them or something 😄
Snowsk8r,"That's a HUGE plus in my book - the mosquito thing! I just had my 3rd of 6 chemos today, and I started getting muscle neuropathy on cycle 1 (Taxol/Carboplatin). I was lucky enough to get the muscle neuropathy that hardly anyone gets - 5% - yay me! I also getting hands and feet neuropathy 4 days out of cycle 2 and it was very persistent (4 weeks later to the day) so we're dropping Taxol completely. I was lucky that it was stage 1a, but it's a super rare ovarian cancer and grade 3 so I'm doing this as a preventative. What I'm seeing is that if it comes back, I'm dead in 2-3 years. So I'm glad no more Taxol, but also terrified it'll come back. Then I go on here and read so many people with persistent symptoms and THAT terrifies me lol. It's just a lose-lose all around. BOO!"
CoffeeB4Talkie,"2x survivor here (different cancers). Side effects didn't get better, I just got used to it and try my best to accommodate my issues accordingly."
Abject-Book-2894,"21F currently, coming up on 16 years post Ependymoma, brain cancer, treatment. I didn’t have chemo, as it wasn’t part of the standard treatment at the time, but I did have radiation treatment. I haven’t had severe hearing loss. But I do have, what I’m not 100% on the name, “ghost tones”. Basically a constant ringing in my ears, that outside of my ears I can’t hear tone wise. And (a little less scientific) with the “what tones can different ages hear” I basically land in like the 40-50 year old range. Not as severe as loosing hearing completely. But definitely changes in hearing."
Present-Ad-8821,"28 now, will be 8 years off treatment for osteosarcoma later this year. I began to notice hearing loss after I finished treatment. My oncologist was surprised it was that noticeable (despite 4 rounds of cisplatin). I had it tested originally like 2years post treatment then didn’t retest again till like 5 years after that and it had gotten worse. Had it retested last summer and it hasn’t decreased, but I do have high frequency hearing loss. The audiologist said I shouldn’t be noticing it much, but I really am! These comments are so validating. I struggle BIG time with hearing when there’s background noise. I also DREAD talking on the phone. Apparently there are certain letter sounds that are harder to hear when you have loss at certain frequencies. I teach so work with little kids and was told they can be especially hard to understand . The most recent audiologist suggested looking at audio processing issues (which I’m sure I have, just not sure if it’s related to chemo). Testing is not covered by insurance so I haven’t done it, but I’d be curious to see my results. It can be so embarrassing sometimes to not hear!"
Express_Fuel_5771,"I work in pediatric radiology and have 2 kids of my own! When I’m not wearing my cochlear implants, I struggle SO much more to hear and understand them than I do to understand my husband. Have you tried hearing aids? I’d consider researching cochlear implants to see if you would be interested in going that route. Hearing aids did nothing for me. I have tinnitus, as well as high frequency loss. I am diagnosed bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss. I couldn’t live without my cochlear implants. In normal conversation with my hearing, I comprehend less than 20% of words. With my implants on, I comprehend 90-95%. They’re also Bluetooth capable and connect to my phone so it makes phone calls so much easier. I’m young too (33) and they changed my life when I got them at 26."
RabbitAunt,Yes. I (43F) had cisplatin my first round of chemo but couldn’t finish the treatment cycles because it almost killed me. I had carboplatin the second time around and developed tinnitus in both ears. It’s not too loud but it’s constant. I also have a very hard time hearing what people are saying if there is background noise.
Express_Fuel_5771,How long has it been since you stopped treatment?
CoffeeB4Talkie,"Yes. I also had Cisplatin. I have hearing loss and now my kidney's are a little wonky (spilling protein in my urine). I haven't seen a doctor about the hearing loss. I guess I'm just tired of doctors and diagnosis at this point. How would you describe your hearing loss? For me, it's certain pitches that I just can't hear at all (high pitches). For example my husband was talking to someone nodded to their car and said 'belt issue?' When we were alone I asked how he knew that... and he looked at me all confused and said ""Ummm the car was squeaking....???"" I was shocked because I couldn't hear it. When people are talking to me sometimes it's like I'm in a pool underwater and the people talking to me are above water. I have to pay very close attention. Normally I try to read lips, but that's pretty hard when people are wearing masks. lol And then add the tinnitus on top of that.... Low pitches are hard to hear, but if I focus really hard I can hear (which annoys me when people talk to me from across the room, another room or with their backs turned to me because I can't hear you! Duh!).. or again, I try to read lips. My husband jokes and says it's selective hearing, but it's not. It's actually frustrating."
Express_Fuel_5771,"Sorry to hear about your kidneys! Was that a side effect you saw pretty immediately? I definitely cannot hear high pitch sounds. I struggle with low pitches, but I think it is mostly because of the tinnitus. My tinnitus is loud and a combination of several different ringing and buzzing tones. When I don’t wear my cochlear implants, I can hear slightly. It doesn’t sound like I’m underwater, maybe more like I’m in a tunnel and they’re standing at the other end talking at normal volume. I struggled bad with my hearing for 7 years before I got cochlear implants. Hearing aids made no difference. The volume is definitely an issue, but more-so clarification. With my implants, I hear and comprehend approximately 95% in conversation, even with background noise. They’re a god send. I just worry that my retained normal hearing will continue to decline and that one day, I will be completely deaf."
TitanKneeUm-Dude,"Same with me, received Cisplatin for my osteosarcoma in my right knee when I was 9 and have experienced hearing loss and on top of that I've also been struggling with tinitus since then, a marvelous combination if you'd ask me."
Express_Fuel_5771,How old are you now? Do you think your hearing loss is about the same directly post trauma as it is now or is it better/worse? Do you wear any type of aid?
Time_Requirement5318,"I (18F) was diagnosed with osteosarcoma at 15. Cisplatin was one of the chemo I received, I have really bad tinnitus and have trouble hearing high pitched sounds. It it also very hard for me to pick up words/sounds when there is a lot of background noise."
brekko10,"My (37M) last round of cisplatin left me with severe tinnitus and high-pitch hearing loss in my right ear. It’s been pretty stable for the last couple of years, but the tinnitus is nonstop and loud. I’ve tried hearing aids but didn’t get any relief, but I’m kind of used to it now. Cisplatin is some powerful poison!"
Express_Fuel_5771,"I tried hearing aids as well! They didn’t do much at all for me. After 7 years, I got my first cochlear implant. After 9 years, I got my second. I’m almost 15 years out now and my “natural hearing” without my cochlear implants on has declined since my initial audiogram."
Snowsk8r,"How many rounds did you do? I'm supposed to do 6 rounds of Carboplatin, which I believe is Cisplatin's younger brother. I've already got neuropathy starting at 2 rounds and kinda terrified it's gonna stay forever if I continue. Doc's gonna decrease my Taxol by 20% so hopefully next round's better."
Express_Fuel_5771,"I only receiving Cisplatin in my last two rounds of chemo. After the first round, the tinnitus started but went away within a week. After the second round, roaring tinnitus that never left. I tried hearing aids for years and am now implanted with cochlear implants. I can’t hear much without them."
Adventurous_Drama_56,Try using plastic utensils. It helped me.
barleydogmom,My mom experienced the same issues. Her doctor placed her on Mirtazapine and it helped her by stimulating her taste and desire to eat.
halfakoala,"Ask his doctor for food supplements, sometimes not much you can do if they don't eat. There are food supplements, made in sterile environment and uht packed. Similar to baby formula or protein milkshakes. They don't have much of a taste, some flavors like strawberry, banana or vanilla. Good luck with your dad's treatment."
ellab58,All I could eat was tacos.
Mother-Awareness-176,Ensure and homemade smoothies were easier for my mom to get.
Blueporch,"I don’t know if it works with patients undergoing chemo, but they did a study with the elderly and found they ate more from red plates. Worth a shot."
whitet86,This happened to my dad. He used to love chocolate and he couldn’t eat it for his last few months. One of the many cruel things that cancer takes away from you.
Party_Author_9337,I ate pretzels and watermelon the week after chemo. It causes a really bad taste in my mouth. So I didn’t have much of an appetite
kaisooh,"My mom had a dietitian video visit once a week during her chemoradiation therapy. It was arranged by the clinic, but you can probably ask for a referral for one. They are helpful in giving guidances when you are not sure what to do. I find what worked for my mom was high protein drinks like Ensure or Boost. As I remember it was about 2 to 3 bottles per day. We also used a blender to liquify other food to make it easier to eat. Her pain in the esophagus grew with time and she was barely able to get through the last week and a couple weeks after the treatment. Those were the toughest times in terms of eating."
peterdwyn,Talk to your team. Get creative. I had the same thing and was told to eat anything and everything a could. Losing weight is not good.
AnnualTeach5232,We got the American cancer society cook books and found a few recipes that were helpful. Ginger raisin pumpkin muffins were a win. My husband needs soft food with very little spice because mouth sores from chemo. Smoothies. Low acid drinks. Ensure shakes or protein shakes. Bagels with peanut butter? Try for higher protein. Also eating more often can offset nausea if that is an issue. Hunger can increase nausea. Ice cream. Popsicles. I would say just get calories.
missmypets,"Chemo works because it destroys fast growing cells. That includes the tastebuds as well as hair, cilia, and bone marrow. One thing that may help with flavor of foods is using bamboo or plastic utensils to eat. -platin drugs make everything taste metallic, using an alternate helps offset that. Barleydogmom mentioned appetite stimulants. There are several that have been approved for patients like your dad, in addition to the Mirtazapine, your doctor might consider megace or marinol. Both are artificial canabinoids and FDA approved, insurance should cover them. If you live in a medical marijuana state, talk to a licensed dispensary about which CBD might be appropriate. Experiment with flavors. Things he used to love, he'll hate. Things he used to hate he may enjoy. The platinum drug he's receiving can only be taken 4-6 times. Their effect will wear off and his appetite should return."

RainbowMumma,"That's so reassuring, thank you so much for sharing your own experience and the links. Im sure you must have been through the mill so it's great to hear that you are here to tell your story. I know I shouldn't do it but everything you read on Google is so disheartening (she's a pessimistic so and so) that's why I've turned to reddit to hear real people talk. Thank you again, appreciate it x"
SailIllustrious1254,"I'm so sorry to hear about your Dad's diagnosis - it's like a brick wall hitting you and it's a lot to take in. My advice is to think of ways that could make your parents lives easier so, running to appointments is great already! You could maybe offer to cook a meal or laundry etc everyday chores. As others have said on other posts (including mine) time is the most precious - you could maybe do day trips together or something I got my parents and I to do was fill out a favourite things questionnaire I made up and we've just been ticking different things off so, watching each other's favourite movies or cooking each other's favourite meals/having snacks etc! When I found out about my Mum's diagnosis I found a therapist as it is a lot to take in so something to be mindful of! I hope your Dad's cancer is not advanced and that there are options for him for treatment 💖 Lots of hugs!"
RainbowMumma,"It really is like hitting a brick wall. Running them to appointments seems so simple at the moment, but my mum did say earlier that she is glad I was with them (not that I was looking for praise, it's just nice to hear that I'd done something to help, even though to me it was something so minor). I've thought about cooking for them and I definitely will, saves them having to think about food. I love the favourite things questionnaire, thank you for the idea! It's my dad's 60th birthday this weekend so we're going away together and I'm so glad that after the news today, my dad is still up for it. Thank you so much, I really hope so. I hope your mum is doing okay Sending hugs back 💕"
ssjesses,"It’s so overwhelming. I find just taking the next step, then the next helps with perspective. There is a ton of stuff coming at you. My sister and I set up a google calendar to help keep the appointments straight, and we asked the dr if we could record the appointments so we wouldn’t forget what they said (I live in a two party state where you have to get their consent). Most of them will allow it but some won’t. The ones that won’t did allow the other sibling to be on speaker so you can have more ears (we couldn’t both be at all appointments). My mom was sort of checked out so this really helped in explaining what the next step was when she felt she could handle it. Best of luck to you and your family. Cancer sucks!"
ttbap,"My dad was recently diagnosed with stage 3. Doctors have a treatment plan in place and the chemo is going really well. This might sound silly but, To help your mom, maybe you can reiterate about ‘the uncertainty around things’ - from crossing a road to boarding a plane. This ‘just’ being another one of those uncertainties that your dad is going through. And with the current medical state of chemo treatment, immunotherapy, radiation therapy, things are very likely to get better! Solution oriented approach to this might also relieve one’s mind - post the PET CT, and based on doctor’s plan of treatment, start the suggested therapy asap(this is very important). Maintain a protein rich diet. Good wishes to you and your family. Hope your father recovers soon."
RainbowMumma,"Thank you for your encouraging words and advice. I'm so glad to hear the chemo is going so well for your dad. How is he feeling overall? Any side effects from chemo? I know everyone will react differently. Thank you so much, I hope your dad's journey continues to go well"
itsbeach,"Okay. Follow the guidance of your oncologist, but it’s important to get other opinions. Advocate for your dad. It’s normal to do so. I’m a stage IV NSCLC survivor. It was first found as a 3cm mass in my upper right lobe. I had surgery to remove the lobe and chemo, but this was in 2009. It came back and was restaged as IV. I’m still here. So much has changed. Get opinions. Ask your docs what they would do if they were in your dad’s shoes. Listen. So much research has been done in the past 10 years that have resulted in amazing treatments. Keep pushing! Hugs."
Littlelady617,My dad is was diagnosed in May. It’s so hard to watch your parent struggle with this disease. My dad is stage 3B. One 7 cm mass in left lung and one lymph node affected. According to his oncologist he is considered curable which was the best news I’ve ever received. He’s had 3 rounds of chemo and immunotherapy. Scans next week and if all is going well he’ll have one more round of chemo then surgery to remove the tumor and part of his lung. I try not to let myself think negatively at this point. I was in a very bad place for months leading up to his final diagnosis. Do not google anything. So much misinformation out there and it caused me a lot of unnecessary anxiety
ElectricalMedium2230,I’m stage 3B NED NSCLC diagnosed last year. Right now they’re in the hardest part - the not knowing- the no plan but once those things fall into place it’ll get better
annacosta13,"Hi. I’m in a similar boat with my husband. He was diagnosed 18 months ago with SCLC which at the beginning spread to lymph nodes , lungs and adrenal glands. He had treatment which kept it all at bay. Last month MRI showed mets to the brain. He doesn’t want more treatment despite being offered whole brain radiotherapy that might or might not give him more time. Right now he has chest infection and yesterday I thought it’s the end. We are with local hospice now which have been really good to us. I guess it’s a waiting game now because nothing else can be done. Our hospice nurse said it’s all different for everyone , she said that at the end people just stop eating and drinking and just sleep a lot. It’s a tough one. I’m trying to spend as much time with my husband as possible and just be there for him which I’m sure you are doing for your mum. Stay strong ."
SailIllustrious1254,"Hi there, thank you for replying and I'm so sorry to hear about your husband. It's such a weird and awful time, you feel like you're stuck in a limbo just waiting. Passing lots of hugs to you 💖"
halfakoala,"My heart goes out to you. I have been through pretty much the same, my dad had stage 4 lung cancer and doctors told me he has 6 months to a year left to live. His appetite was good until the last week, he had trouble breathing and standing for a minute was hard for him. He had taken two rounds of chemo but never had nausea or lost his appetite. On his last week, he started to get nausea and he threw up everything he ate. On a Friday, he went into ICU, they told me I couldn't see him until Monday due to not having enough personnel on call for weekends, and at 3am on Monday the hospital called me. Till that call, I still had hoped to see him on Monday. My advice to you is, Just stay with her. You may never be able to guess the time so spend as much time as you can with her. I'm sorry you are going through this."
SailIllustrious1254,"I'm so sorry for the loss of your Father 💖 Thank you for your well wishes and you are right about spending time, I'm very grateful for my place of work as they have given me as much time off as needed which is a huge luxury not everyone can have."
Humble_Emotion2582,"This all sucks so much. I am so sorry for everybody that has to go through this. Myself, I am stage 3 and would really like to know these things. I have two young daughters ( 2 & 5 ) and know that I will not live to see them grow up. I want to know what to look out for to know when it is time and prepare everyone as much as possible. But doctors wont tell :("
SailIllustrious1254,"That's heartbreaking for you and I'm so sorry you're going through this 💖 I think Dr's are worried that they'll be liable or someone will say 'you said they had 6 months left and we only got 2!' Which I understand but, I feel like even telling people what to look for or expect will help give people a sense of control over what's happening to them instead of just sitting around waiting and not knowing :("
JohnnyAppleseed23457,"I've never asked, doctor has never said. We all know there is an end, but none of us know when. Go by how well they are this week, compared to last. I did that with both my parents when they had cancer. But, like I said, we don't know. I'm sorry for your pain and grief. This is the hardest journey that I have ever taken. Being there is a gift for you both. We are all here for you."
PlugSocket_,"Sorry for your situation, my mum is in a very similar position. Went into A&E 3 weeks ago with suspected stroke due to right sided paralysis and slurred speech. To find she has advanced lung cancer that's spread to her brain and bones. There is nothing they can do for her , she's still completely paralysed down her right side. There's been such a battle to get her discharged. But I'm praying she can get into the hospice tomorrow as her pain is quite complex. They told us weeks to months, but again very vague and unclear."
InterestingLook646,I started hospice last week and I'm curious too because I'm just uncomfortable. Pain is manageable and everything but I'm restless and ready to go. I have teenagers and a husband and large family but I'm just really ready to not be uncomfortable. I'm probably looking at six weeks and it will be uncomfortable. 😞
Anon-567890,"Gosh, I’m so sorry to hear this. I know how awful you all must feel! This is such a shock. It is so difficult being patient through the complete diagnostic process. They will test his biopsy for mutation markers and PD-L1 which will guide the oncology team in forming a treatment plan, whether targeted therapy if he has certain markers to immunotherapy with adequate PD-L1. There could be chemo or radiation in the mix. Those alternative options are not something I’d focus on. Stem cell therapy is only in clinical trials. You should have access to excellent oncologists in the Seattle area. Listen to them as they form a treatment plan. I wish you all the best. Keep us updated! (I’m 9 years out from a Stage IV adenocarcinoma diagnosis with 6 recurrences, just FYI.)"
metalchode,"Wow 6 reoccurrences, you are a trooper! Happy to hear you are still doing ok and wish you a full recovery. Thanks for sharing 🙏"
pilarofsociety,"My mum (65) was diagnosed two months ago with stage 4 NSCLC (adenocarcinoma). It was a huge shock as she’s a non-smoker and has always been quite healthy. I’d strongly recommend a biopsy with genetic testing if that’s not already been requested. Some lung cancers occur due to a genetic mutation (like EGFR) and there’s targeted treatment available (Tagrisso for EGFR) that’s highly effective for most patients with such mutation. Stage 4 cancer is a lot to deal with, but I can say our family is in a much better place now than at the start, when there was so much uncertainty, fear, and not knowing how to navigate through it all. You will work it out together. Sending you strength."
Due-Emu4273,"My (33F) mom (63F) was diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC adenocarcinoma with malignant pleural effusion on June 17. Her original treatment plan was going to be chemo, however, they first found out through various testing that she had a PD-L1 % of 50%, which responds well to immunotherapy (elevates your immune system to fight the cancer). Then at a follow up appointment we found out that my mom has a targetable mutation (EGFR) which made her a candidate for targeted therapy with a once daily oral medication, Tagrisso. There are different targetable mutations so, if it hasn’t already been done for your dad, I’d say the genetic testing is worth the cost. I believe it’s called Tempus testing, if you’d like to research. There are so many unknowns when starting out, but it does get better! Make sure your dad keeps eating and keeps weight on as that may become more difficult. There are books about cancer diets if that’s something you’re interested in. Support groups can help both your dad and yourself as well. Sending you and your family positivity and strength."

Wyde1340,"Stage 4 squamous here. I was dx in December 2018 and doing well. I do have a biomarker known as MET. So, If he has non-small cell, make sure he gets biomarker testing (Next Generation Sequencing), not just the test for the ones they have targeted therapies for. I'm sorry you're going through this. It's awful and treatment may suck, but there is hope. Not sure if you're a Facebook user, but there are support groups over there with more people."
spacebtween,Fred Hutch is world renown.
coffee_riot_148,"Stage 4 lung cancer here. Had a melanoma on my toe and that digit got hacked off but not before the cells traveled into my lungs. Now I have a mass the size of a kiwi fruit and some smaller nodules too. Starting immunotherapy on Wednesday. I'm being treated at Virginia Commonwealth University's Massey Cancer Center and they're keeping me positive. My oncologist is very professional and never gave me a vibe of doom. Chemo kind of freaked me out because it's basically a poison. Immunotherapy was the only recommended therapy (for the time being) because it's a drug that boosts your own immune system into hyperdrive.It's one IV that takes 30 minutes and it's a monthly dose. I'm 51, so maybe age and health is a factor, but doc said after some time and constant monitoring adjustments can be made and there are clinical studies I could enter. At no time did my team tell me how bad it is, nor my chance of survival, or a time period left to live and I like it that way. Since Day 1 of my diagnosis (June 17) I'VE held onto the PMA (positive mental outlook). That's all I can do under the circumstances. My only advice for you while your father undergoes this cancer shit-show is to reach out to him, tell him you love him all the time and make him talk about his feelings, Try to carve out a bit of time here and there. Especially once the real shit starts. Even if it's just dropping off a meal. Much love on your family's journey."
OldYak774,Hugs!!
metalchode,Thanks 🙏
montaukwhaler,"I believe that Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and Fred Hutch merged, so Seattle is one of the best places in the US to get cancer care. Fred Hutch also supports Integrative Medicine, and Seattle probably has other complimentary/alternative therapies available. Also, buy or borrow the book ""Radical Remission"" by Kelly Turner. I had stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer but mine just had tumors in my lungs on both sides, not to distant organs, so definitely not as serious as your dad's. I was diagnosed in 2013, had chemo, surgery, radiation, chemo again, chemo once more, and finally SBRT radiation, and have scanned tumor free since 2015. I also did a TON of alternative and complimentary therapies. I was relatively young (53) and in general good health when diagnosed, so that helped as well. My surgery was at UW Medical Center/Seattle Cancer Care Alliance and my care there was excellent. Additional advice: keep a notebook with detailed notes of every office visit and several copies of all test results and scans. This will be REALLY helpful when your dad gets 2nd and 3rd opinions. Your dad will definitely get better care if you, or his spouse, or another friend or family member works as his advocate. My wife literally made my healthcare her full time job and advocated for me and I'm positive that she saved my life by being aggressive. It's basically impossible to do alone. All the best to you and your dad!!!"
metalchode,Thank you so much! I ordered the book and we will definitely call Fred Hutch. Best to you 😊
SprinklesPitiful7027,Hi! Can you share what complimentary therapies you did along with treatment?
Maleficent-Sock7067,"My father is 68, Stage 3A Adenocarcinoma, unresectable. He is on a very similar regimen. He was originally scheduled for 6 rounds of chemo concurrent with 30 rounds of radiation. Due to some of his blood counts he was only able to complete 5 rounds of chemo but did complete all of his radiation. He has been on immunotherapy/ Imfinzi since January this year. His last CT scan showed his tumor was growing, but the PET scan came back not showing any cancer? His next CT scan is in two weeks so we will see what that shows. Overall he seems to be doing pretty well all things considered. Best of luck to you and your husband, this disease is tough on everyone. Praying for the best outcome for you all."
Successful-112,Thanks much. Stay positive and keep fighting.
Successful-112,anyone tried the immunotherapy imfinz with success?
OffMyRocker2016,"Not for me. I've tried it when I was initially at stage IIIB (with 100% PDL expression) and I failed on it right away, after the first 3 month cycle, unfortunately. Then I tried Keytruda next and I failed miserably on that immunotherapy, too, sadly. It was devastating for me because I was so hopeful with having such a high PDL expression, but it just didn't work out for me. People with 50% or higher PDL expression typically can do very well with immunotherapy treatment. Now, I'm very happy to report that, although I'm stage IV, for 2.5 years now (cross myself lol), I'm back on chemo that was one of my first line treatments 3.7 years ago, Taxol (paclitaxel), and so far I'm doing pretty well on it. Just had my first 3 month scans after starting back on it and I'm currently stable/shrinking my liver mets, thankfully. I'm hoping to stay on this for at least another 3-9 months or more if im super lucky.. fingers crossed. Everyone is different though and many factors are involved in treatment success or failure along the process. Late stage cancer is a bitch. Constantly switching treatments is just part of the Whack-a-Mole game we have to play in these later stages of our cancer life, unfortunately. It's kind of like chasing your tail in a way. Lol But you just do your best to get through it, one scan at a time, with lots of hope for good results in each one. 🌻"
OffMyRocker2016,"Oh..I forgot to mention that I had the similar treatment plan and know his throat pain well. Had 30 sessions of radiation to my primary in the right lower lobe and my medistinal lymph nodes (center of chest) and it was beyond awful. At the same time, I was on Carbo/Taxol for 6 weeks at that time. It's going to take some time, like a couple of months after completion, for his soreness to improve, imo. That burn is something else and I'll never forget it. Ugh. I had hydrocodone oral syrup to use/take 30 minutes before eating and that was a lifesaver on top of the extended release morphine tablets and lidocaine oral solution as well to drink. Great 3-med combo that really helped me eat pretty successfully every day. My Rad Onc is the best! Lol"
peterdwyn,I was there. The outcome is killing cancer. Somehow eat. Smoothies anything. One thing at a time and he will make it. One step at a time. Dont worry about immuno now. Get through the chemo and radiation. You can do it.
Lost_Karma,"All side effects can be treated. Ask oncology for something called magic mouthwash, it has lidocaine and other meds. That along with Pepcid and carafate got me through the phase of everything I ate or drank was like broken glass. yes the chemo radiation phase is awful I ended up hospitalized after first 3 rounds for a week to 10 days each time. Now for the good news I started as extensive stage small cell and 2 years later tumor has become much smaller and bone Mets are gone. I am getting immunotherapy every 3 weeks only complaint with that is fatigue."
Intelligent_Bear_984,"I had chemo (paxol & carboplatin) w/30 radiation then Imfenzi every other week for a year. Also was 3c my experience with Imfenzi was great, I had little to no symptoms at all. Chemo was rough but I was able to power though it. This was 2018 and I'm still doing pretty well!! If your Dad can just make it past chemo/ radiation the immunotherapy ( Imfenzi) is totally different. Wishing him all the best it's not easy at times."
TemporaryLocation178,"My husband has stage 4b nsclc with skull mets with spread to lymph nodes in mid chest, and to clavicle. Mirtazapine (Remeron and Remeronsoltab) was a godsend to treat his sleeplessness and to increase his appetite. He has gained a good amount of weight since he started taking it. It is also used to treat depression. He also takes 5 mg of oxy as needed for pain. He did okay through chemo but radiation wiped him out. My husband is currently on Krazati (adagrasib) with good results. He did a short stint with Keytruda but it wasn't working well for him. It can be heartbreaking to watch someone go through various treatments that seem to being more harm than good. We keep looking ahead and take things day by day. Some days are just bad days and we have to accept those days. I would definitely ask your husband's doctor about Mirtazapine. We also found prescribed anti-nausea medicine good to have on hand. I have learned to encourage my husband to rest as much as possible and to do what he can when can. Some days he can only take care of himself. Other days he makes dinner. Keeping good thoughts for you and your husband."
VikingMonkey123,How old is your hubby? My wife age 45 starts soon also 3b.
Melwaukee17,"Hey! Welcome to the really awful club. I don’t live in the same state as my mom, and I’ve been flying in for every round of chemo (every three weeks). She’s on the same combo as your dad will be. My Dad is home with my Mom, so I can’t speak fully to the him being alone preparedness, but I even want to get my mom a life alert thing or something to wear for if she’s down and no one notices quick enough. The biggest side effect for these combo of meds so far is sleepiness. The 24 hours post infusion your dad will have some energy because they infuse a steroid with the chemo, so there’s a little energy boost there. Then come Sunday/Monday he’ll be overwhelmingly sleepy. My mom is not a ~sleepy~ person and these meds have been knocking her out for days post chemo. My biggest help has been doing things around the house for her while she’s sleeping. Appetite is also suppressed, so try to find something that your dad will eat no matter what. You also have to give a pretty direct pep talk to your dad of “if you want a chance to fight this, you HAVE to eat. You can’t lose weight.” My mom needed this pep talk because as a woman she always celebrated losing weight. But now it’s an extremely bad thing. My last anecdote, is odds are you’re going to meet with the oncologist before the infusions just for discussions and updates. Idk if either of you guys are medical, but please look into as much as you can and make a list of any pertinent questions you want to ask the doctor. My mom leaves every single aspect of her care up to me, so if I don’t “know” whah the doctor is saying we’re all screwed, so I go into every appointment at the ready with every single bit of knowledge I can muster. It’s a depressing reality to face, but the US healthcare system isn’t set up so that most patients are ~cared~ about or ~advocated~ for. So you really have to fight for attention and answers. It’s rough. Good luck to you guys on the start of it all. there’s a lot of guilt that goes into being a not nearby child and I’m right there with you. My therapist helps me talk it out weekly lol. Keep the hope going for your dad because at the end that’s all we got."
Anon-567890,"Great answer and may I just add that staying hydrated is of utmost importance? I drink tons of water in the first few days to flush out toxins. I’m lucky I love water and drink it exclusively, and always have “my emotional support water bottle” right by my side always! 🤣"
bdpna,"Wow, what a fantastic answer. So sorry to hear about your mom as well. That has to be very stressful to do all that traveling and be so far away but wow, what a fantastic kid you are. Unfortunately, my dad has not been sleeping much at night since getting the lung cancer. The primary tumor is so close to his esophagus that he has constant phlegm that is exacerbated when he tries to lay horizontal. Anything but sitting up right in the chair and he has problems. It has been really hard to watch. So maybe one positive side effect if he gets tired enough is that he will actually get real sleep. Much like your mom, my dad was celebrating losing weight before his diagnosis. Since then he has been trying to eat, but it has been a real struggle. Unfortunately, we haven’t found much that he enjoys as everything is tasteless and struggle to put down with no desire. I’m a little concerned about this so will continue to do my best to advocate that he eat even when it is the last thing on his mind. Thanks so much for that. My dad sounds a lot like your mom and his doctor meetings. I have been in every single meeting and the one asking most of the questions. My dad‘s doctor is also a little older and seems to have the clinical approach, but not really a lot of additional bedside manner. My dad doesn’t mind as he is the same way. I prefer a little more detail from the doctor and not the feeling like he’s rushing to get to the next patient or the next thing.that said, I’m pretty well schooled on what my dad has, at least more than I was a month ago. I sure do ask a lot of questions and hope to continue to ask the right ones when given the opportunity. Your mom is very lucky to have your dad. I do wish someone could always be there with him, but given him my sister’s family commitments and my work commitments that is just not a practical thing right now. We are going to do our best to be there in person as much as possible and via technology every single day. My very best wishes to you and your family during this difficult time."
MyChickenSucks,"That’s almost exactly my mom, age and drugs. She’s never been an active person and old age really set in hard. But other than some nausea for 2 days after her first round, she feels ok. I did teach her how to say “hey Google call XXX” should she need help. She lives alike but in a senior community with my sister very close by"
bdpna,"Thanks for the reply, my best wishes to you and your Mom in this rough time. It sure has been a stressful summer."
Party_Author_9337,"I was 39 when I did my chemo for lung cancer. It wiped me out days 3-6 I would take multiple naps a day. I would purchase a urinal from Amazon incase the fatigue from chemo makes it hard for your dad to get to the bathroom. Also, have his doctors prescribed a Walker? Or maybe useful if you have to take him back to the office the first week post chemo. Has he tried sleeping with a wedge pillow? Google pills for acid reflex. That might help keep him upright but let him stretch out in bed. I am glad he is drinking water now. Chemo can change your taste buds for a week or two. So water may taste bad. Buy some flavored water packets. Don’t stock up on anything pre chemo. I also lived alone and I bought what I thought I would want to eat if I had the stomach but. But my taste was so off, I didn’t want any of it. Made me hate the taste of the yellow gatoraid. Which was my favorite. I was able to drink the blue flavor, which I normally don’t like. If he is already really bad at eating, you might want to look into continuous glucose monitor. See if he would wear it. That way you can see if his sugar is going too low from not eating"
EcstaticAd2743,"Hi! My mom just started this journey - she’s on alimta, carbo and keytruda. Her first treatment was last Monday. She felt great the day of, after and 3rd day after treatment. 4th and 5th day she felt pretty fatigued and low appetite, she took the nausea meds those days just to get her appetite up - she did not feel nauseated. Day 6 appetite picked up quite a bit and fatigue has improved just a little bit. Now we are on day 8, still feeling a bit fatigued. She drinks a lot of water and exercises- even if it’s just a walk in the yard - and drinks clean protein shakes in addition to 6 small meals a day. I also got her a bag of electrolyte packets that she’s takes every other day."
bdpna,Wow sounds like she is tolerating very well! The eating and movement are big things. My dad struggles in both now so hoping the treatment may change that for him at least during the non tired days. Wishing Continued good progress to your mom!!!
Jmtb3601,"I’m on Carboplatin + Alimta + Keytruda and the pharmacist at MD Anderson who went over all the meds and side effects told me that the B12 shot I would receive at my treatment as well as the anti-naseau meds would hold up through the first couple of days and the B12 and corticosteroids I take on day 2, 3 and 4 after chemo would keep my energy up and inflammation down. I was like the energizer bunny for the first two days (also couldn’t sleep). She also told me the fatigue from Keytruda would likely be felt on week 2. Outside of having to take zofran on day three (had an unsettled stomach), she was spot on. Also be prepared for a rash, super dry skin, AND constipation (Miralax). Week three was pretty smooth and much more energy. Hope this helps."
bdpna,"Well, the day is here. I'll try and keep a journal here or start a new post if it feels more helpful. My sister is taking him to the first treatment today and we are alternating. I'll be spending several days living with him after he gets home today. From what we hear the first day and night are not bad but anywhere up to ""day 5"" (I assume treatment counts as ""day 1"") can be the worst of it, so I want to be there. Since he lives an hour away from each of us but wants to be home, this was our best plan we could devise. We are thankful for the schedule of 3 weeks between treatments though realize this means he'll be getting a lot today, so we are hoping for the best but ready for the worst with side effects. I'll share that stuff here when I get a chance, just hoping that we are ready. Ironically (probably by design) Dad had the best 2 days since diagnosis this week, the palliative radiation given to the lung tumor finally got his cough and phlegm under control, took 2 more weeks past the last treatment to finally start giving results, so it is true that radiation keeps working many weeks or even months (TBD?) after it ends. Of course, after those good 2 days he's right back into the dumps with the chemo starting today. Our biggest concerns are if he will have issues with bathroom activities (that has been a struggle between constipation and the other extreme) and his weight loss continues at about 3 pounds per week due to lack of appetite. We're expecting him to mostly just want to sleep and be inactive during the first week of each chemo cycle. So it will be a challenge to get him to drink and eat if he is mostly sleeping. And then we are of course hopeful to avoid the nausea. I will post more when I can in the days ahead, any feedback always helpful. Also hoping this post can be useful to any others down the road who are going through a similar medicine combo."
bdpna,"As promised here's an update. We are on day 5 after the first infusion. Figure I can leave this all here, helpful to those who may find it later, as other posts on history of treatments have helped us to get ready. So due to the steroid he had a great day at treatment, they treated him well with meds and comfort in a massage chair and snacks. He enjoyed the day very much and ""loved"" chemo. Ha! He had a huge energy burst that lasted the next 2-3 days after treatment due to steroids in the IV as well as the pills. We are on day 5 now and this is the start of the ""crash"". I will note the palliative radiation to his primary in his chest finally started to have positive effects just before the chemo which helped resolve his cough and appetite somewhat. So that plus the steroids, he has been able to return to bed to sleep and eating/drinking while nowhere near regular levels did increase. He tried some normal non-sugar food and was able to get some down also was able to drink way more fluids after chemo. Which I hope will help. Top two issues on day 5, constipation which has been a problem for a while now, we are trying to work on it via a once daily stool softener as well as a laxative pill. We will talk to the docs if these OTC meds do not work. Second side effect started setting in yesterday that is getting worse today is muscle pain and some neuropathy. He is having some trouble walking and having to be VERY careful. Muscle pain was so bad he was unable to sleep last night. We are going to try and manage with OTC tylenol but if it gets no better or worse with the pain and inability to sleep we'll talk to the doc. That's where we are on day 5. My hope is that we have a few rough days and then he gets some better more normal days in the 21 day cycle. Then it starts all over again for at least 5 more treatments. Will try and keep this post updated. As always welcome any comments or questions."
katewinsletsyouth,He will have better days. The worst is over. It’s smooth sailing after the first week.
bdpna,"More updates, again for anyone interested who finds this thread later or anyone with questions or comments now. Dad had second infusion on Friday, this time added Zometa for bone strengthening, the Keytruda, The Taxol (a 3 hour infusion) and the Carboplatin. The taxol is the most brutal of the bunch from what I am reading, with the carboplatin not far behind. Hair loss began about 2 weeks in, still some hair at week 3 but lots falling out as we start the second infusion at 21 days. Infusion days are easy due to steroid given during the process. The mediport worked well. During his nadir visit (halfway between first and second chemo) the white blood cell count was low as well as hemoglobin, came up in time for the second infusion. Doctor said something about needing a blood transfusion if it gets worse future times. Doctor also said he wants to CT scan the cancer areas after the 3rd treatment (9-10 weeks after first chemo) to check progress, since we are not yet seeing any signs of improvement (although I am unsure if we are supposed to, this soon either). Dad continues to have better days than others, big side effects are the following: Sleep disrupted, he sleeps when he can, often an hour here and there throughout the day, thus is not ready for bed at night and is often up half of the night. Cannot sleep on a bed but somehow can sleep on a recliner for an hour, and on a couch on his side for a few hours. We are not sure why this is. Appetite remains awful as ever, except on chemo infusion day when the steroid makes him more hungry and briefly improves taste. Otherwise most food has the wet cardboard sensation and his body rejects swallowing it, thus, eating very little and strength is very low, walking short distances has become a challenge from lack of strength as well as being out of breath The palliative radiation did cure his blood and mucous cough but the cough did return in a more dry fashion here and there for now. The lung was the primary so I guess this is the way it will be,. Constipation, rock hard stools for the first days / week after a chemo infusion. Trying to start stool softeners to manage. Neuropathy in hands fingers is pretty bothersome, also was in feet a bit, doc says Taxol causes this and lowered the dose a bit. Extreme fatigue and low feeling after the steroid pills stop being taken around day 5/6. No nausea at this point which we are at least thankful for. Fairly few words during the low days, on the high days, a lot more talking or communication, often with some repeated stuff or brain fog which may be due to some of the meds the palliative team provided to try and stimulate appetite or promote sleep (but do not seem to be working). Aggression or argumentative state can be a mix, less so on high days / steroid time, more energy and movement but often frantic or erratic. During low days, very quiet and mean. MAJOR pain in his tailbone which doc thinks is a pressure sore due to constant time in chair, not broken open yet but skin is thin there so we have concerns. Not managing with any pain meds other than tylenol which does not work. He did say pain went away after starting steroids. So it likely will return in a few days. That's about where we are at here at the three week mark. Next week, we expect the big crash and then have another Nadir visit to check his bloodwork, and an appointment with palliative care. I may ask for medical THC gummies which are approved in this state, before we move to any opioid type stuff. No other plans right now other than the horrible wait for scans after the 3rd chemo, from being here I know to expect the worst, hope for the best, but am ready for any outcome and then the doc's recommendations. Any questions let me know. I can try to answer."
pilarofsociety,"Really sorry to hear about your mum. I have a similar story. My mum went to see the doctor about back pain a couple of months ago and was diagnosed with stage 4 non-small cell lung cancer that’s metastasised to the spine. The biopsy results will be very important because if she has certain gene mutations she can have targeted treatment (like Tagrisso for EGFR mutation) that can be effective for a while with few side effects. There are people who have taken Tagrisso for years on Reddit and other forums. So make sure they do genetic testing as part of the biopsy. I’d advise against reading the survival stats online. The data is mostly very old, before the availability of targeted treatment. The data also doesn’t separate by age, so you have 80/90 year olds who were near the end alongside much younger people. Sending you strength ❤️"
frostbike,"Great info in this comment. I was diagnosed last year and started chemo after my biopsy confirmed it was cancer but before we had the genetic testing results. The genetic tests revealed that I have an ALK mutation (similar to the EGFR mentioned) and I started taking alectinib. Chemo did nothing to stop my progression, but alectinib has been wonderful. So definitely make sure they do the genetic testing. Also, I very much agree with the recommendation not to read survival stats online. For the first six months or so I only used google to look up words and concepts I didn’t understand from radiology reports and doctor visits."
SurvivalCMod,I had similar symptoms as your mom. I went to ER for suspected stroke last Jan and Turned out to be Stage 4B NSCLC mats to brain. I had full brain radiation for 2 weeks. It shranked the tumors. Then I was on Targrisso for about a year. It kept shrinking tumors (more than 50%) till it stopped working. Now I am on Chemo+ Immunotherpy. Only been 2 cycles. But it seems working. At least my symptoms seem getting better. Good luck.
pennyroyaltea_0,"Sorry you’re going through this… my dad’s lung cancer progressed in a similar way. He was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer with brain mets, and underwent immunotherapy for the lunch cancer. Not much they could do about the brain mets since he already went through radiotherapy some years back. In the end, while the lung cancer stabilized, the brain mets kept growing and caused progressive loss of control in one side of his body. He then underwent gamma knife surgery, which helped a little, and, I believe, prolonged his life by a few more months. Towards his final month, he became bed bound and lost his fine motor skills (eg, couldn’t feed himself), but thankfully was still very conscious and could speak, just like normal. Throughout this time, he also went for physiotherapy to help with maintaining his strength in his hands and legs."
PlugSocket_,"What an awful time for your dad, I'm so sorry. My mum is already pretty much bed bound, I feel like there won't be much they can do at this point. I'm keeping hope they can though :("
scifieyes2276,"my aunt also had the same symptoms. we also thought it was a stroke since she lost control on the left side of her body. found out too late that it is stage 4 lung cancer with mets on the right side of the brain. her oncologist recommended stereotactic therapy, basically blasting her head and chest with radiation to make the mets go smaller. it worked for a bit but the radiotion caused her to have big open sores all over her body."
Previous_Basis8862,I’m so sorry to hear this. My mum had what she and her doctors seemed to think were recurrent sinus and chest infections. She was on antibiotics on and off for 4 months. She started getting joint pain so was finally referred to a rheumatologist who thought she might have an autoimmune disorder and sent her for scans - lung cancer that had already spread to her bones. She was sent for a brain scan too as she was having excruciating headaches but we never got the results of that because unfortunately she passed away from (mainly) pneumonia just 4 weeks after that original scan. Immunotherapy was what the oncologists were talking about as her best chance though and it gave one of my friends and extra 15 months after she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic lung cancer with brain and bone mets. Hopefully they have sent the tissue from the lung biopsy to be tested to see if immunotherapy is an option?
Yourstrulysandy,"My mom (63) was diagnosed with stage 4 nsclc late last yr/early this yr by presenting to the ER with nausea and vomiting which we thought was from vertigo but it was from brain Mets causing severely low sodium. She did 15 sessions of whole brain radiation which removed the Mets. She has RET gene mutation and was given a 3-6 month prognosis if no gene target, and 1 yr if there is a gene to target, but since she had RET she used chemo pills Gavreto for 3 months then had progression and now she’s using Retevmo, she’s currently experiencing a lot of pain and basically bed bound too. We just reached our 8th month since diagnosis. There’s no easy way to navigate this, but there are lung cancer groups on Facebook with people experiencing very similar situations who can help guide you to the right direction with their experience. Hang in there!"
Renegade_Phylosopher,"It somewhat depends on whether it’s non small cell vs. Small cell, the latter spreads at a faster rate and usually has a poorer prognosis."
briarwren,"I'm so sorry. My thoughts are with you and yours, and the candles are lit. My mom is similar; brain mets with small cell lung cancer. We found out a year ago the beginning of May. She had a fast growing tumor that was barely a month old but was causing immense pain. At the time, she'd been fighting to schedule spinal surgery for degenerative disk disease. She was ignoring the pain and not letting us know how bad it actually was. I live almost two hours away, so she was able to play it off over the phone, but my SIL stopped by and managed to bully my strong-willed mother to the ER, which shows how bad it was. She was placed on meds and kept under observation to control the growth, had brain surgery a couple of weeks later, and they were able to remove the vast majority of it. Apparently, it was a close thing. She didn't have a stroke, but she could have, and the doctor said if she hadn't come in when she did, she would be gone. She had several radiation sessions for her brain, got her port, and then healed a bit before beginning her immunotherapy. She was on Optivo and Yrvoy every two weeks (treatments alternated between one and both), although recently, it's just Optivo since her doctor is happy with her current scans. I was with her when he compared the very first lung scan to her most recent one. It was demonstratively smaller and had none of the original junk around it. The doctor said when it reduced by half? (can't recall exactly) again, he would do targeted radiation. The tiny bit left in her head is still dead and not growing, and the other mets are gone."
zeshef,"This is the exact same condition that led my partner to the ER, and now we are 2 months from the initial diagnosis of NSCLC adenocarcinoma stage 4 with lymph, bone and brain metastasis, EGFR exon 19 insertion. If you have questions I would be happy to help answer in a private message. So far it sounds like the hospital is following the standard of care approach based on my experience and understanding."
PlugSocket_,"Hey, so sorry to hear about your partner. The Neuro specialists have said they can't perform any surgery due to the mass on her lung. She'd not survive the operation. So there's nothing they can do for her. I'm trying my hardest to get her into a hospice as she doesn't want to be in hospital anymore."
Party_Author_9337,"Ask about pain medication for home use after the surgery. My surgeon refused to treat pain with opioids. After two to three weeks of unbearable pain, my friend suggested I reach out to my oncologist. She had no issue treating my pain. Use the incentive spirometer. And walk. Sleeping can be uncomfortable. Make sure you have a few comfy pillows in different sizes to help find a position of comfort"
TerracottaGarden,"My cardio thoracic surgeon did the same thing with me! Luckily, I received a phone call from my PCP to check on how I was doing at home after being released from the hospital earlier that week. I was hurting so from the nerve pain, I was in tears. Needless to say, my regular doc (who knew I was NEVER drug seeking) immediately sent in a prescription for opioids."
MindlessParsley1446,"Hi, there and sorry to hear about your husband. I had an upper lobectomy last August. The recovery for me was definitely tolerable with pain medication. I was able to walk just fine, and did so as soon as the weather cooperated (midwesterner here, and weather can be all over the place!). I walked regularly to help improve lung capacity and strength. Sleeping was a challenge, though. I ended up purchasing a wedge pillow set (convertible for various angles and an under-the-knee pillow for support and comfort). I had to sleep sitting straight up for about a month (maybe more, can't remember now!). I also got a neck pillow to support my neck during sleep. I experienced what I call ""zingers"" where the incisions were, so was prescribed Gabapentin to help with that. I had the Robotic-assisted surgery, so about 5 small incisions. Since the opioids blocked me up, I made sure to take stool softener and also powdered Miralax to help keep things moving. Best of luck ❤️"
BuytheTickets,"I had a wedge resection 2 weeks ago. Stock up on absorbent bandages, gauze and tape and stool softener!!! I use a body pillow because I can wrap it around me to support the incision site when I cough or sneeze. Getting in & out of bed is hard so I’ve been nesting on the sofa - wish I had a recliner! I’ve not been good about walking as I should so I’m buying one of those mini-treadmill walking pads. Good Luck!"
Drunktrucker,"I (70M) had a right upper lobectomy for a similar sized nodule that was an adeno carcinoma. I slept in a recliner for a few weeks but I had a complication where my lung was leaking air and had a chest tube for a couple of weeks. I had the robotic surgery so only had 4 small incisions that were not painful . I agree that using the incentive spirometer frequently is important as well as getting up and moving, walking as much as possible. And yes, stool soofteners for sure, start that even before surgery. Metamucil or similar. The opioids given short term post op plugged me up. That was 2 years ago , no other treatment, and last scan in June I was still no evidence of disease and still walk a mile or two most days and drive a Semi part time. Here’s to an uneventful surgery and a speedy recovery."
lives4books,"Thank you and I love this success story. I’m so scared of spread, we happened to find this early and are very fortunate; this waiting weeks til they can get him in for surgery is terrifying. Continued best wishes that this is completely behind you!! 🙏🏼"
sunnygolden17,I just had the same surgery done to left lobe in May. I was unable to get comfortable in my bed for several weeks. I slept in a reclining chair and was much more comfortable. Be sure to always have a small pillow available to hold against your chest as you try to rise from sitting or sleeping. Don’t be surprised if he doesn’t feel like eating - he will regain his appetite. And call the doctor if something just doesn’t seem right.
Starbucksina,"I had a lower left lobe lobectomy last year. For the hospital, get a neck pillow and eye mask. It’s hard to move and get comfy with the drainage tube. Once that is removed he will feel better. Stay on too of pain meds and take laxatives everyday. Use a walker if necessary to move around. Get a wedge pillow. It’s hard to sleep flat for a while. Stay hydrated and use the incentive spirometer. I had a miserable post surgical cough that was treated with tessalon perles. I started to feel better after a month. Did get upgraded from stage 1a to 2b after pathology report so ended up having chemo. Ask about testing for biomarkers if the surgeon didn’t bring it up."
smartypants333,"I got ""the button"" for the 3 days I was in the hospital after my lobectomy. The nurse was also nice enough to set it up so the end would light up when I could have another dose. I was in a lot of pain, and it didn't get a whole lot better once I got home, but unlike some have said, my doctors did gave me opioid pain meds. My oncology team also refilled my prescription anytime I ask. I've been VERY careful not to ""dose up."""
halfakoala,"Mom(65) had the same surgery, she had problems with her kidneys so all pain relief they gave her was some paracetamol. After the surgery, she walked a lot on the hospital corridors, her doctors told her to blow baloons and cough a lot to expand her lungs and prevent liquid built up in her lungs. She had a slight break on one of her ribs and powered through with only Paracetamol. She had x-rays twice a day to examine the lung capacity. Everything went OK and she was sent home in 5 days. She had 3 sessions of preventative chemo. They monitor her now every 3 months with CT scans and MRIs.Her lung have expanded beautifully, and she has less problem breathing and more energy now that she had to quit smoking. Hope everything goes well for you and your husband."
Dejanxns,"If you felt that your were rushed, and no appt until August 30th, maybe 2nd opinion from a teaching hospital if close to you? This disease like it has been said it’s a rollercoaster, and you should be followed closely and have access to your care team."
peterdwyn,Find out who the best treatment for cancer is in Boston and call them. I went through a very similar diagnoses and switched and have no regrets. You deserve the best treatment out there. I believe they’re all good but this is your choice. You deserve to speak with your oncologist and have question answered.
puffedovenpancake,Have you been to dana farber? One of the best places for cancer and right in your city.
StrainTraditional969,That's where I am going. I am thinking it's this Dr. who is too busy or just lousy bedside manner. I am going to request someone new. And probably get a second opinion if that doesn't work. I think I fell through a crack.
Anon-567890,What country are you in? You should have regular appointments with your oncologist. When does chemo begin?
behindthelens83,"Honestly, I’m in the same boat. My mom is 65, stage IV with brain Mets. Her difference is that her PDL1 is 80%. She started with 5 rounds of radiation to the chest and one round to the brain. She’s had three chemo rounds, the last two with Keytruda. She’s needed quite a few blood transfusions and has been hospitalized once with a skin infection. This disease and stage are a rollercoaster. You really don’t know what to expect and things happen quickly with little notice. Ask lots of questions. Have you had a follow up CT to see if the radiation did anything?"
JohnnyAppleseed23457,"Do you have any kind of health app? Available???Like, My Chart or Sydney? Or any others?? I can see my appointments Scan results, medications, health history send messages and much more.... Just an excellent resource in navigation of my cancer diagnosis and now treatment. I make a lot of calls too. Good Luck 👍"
missmypets,"Dana Farber has Nurse Navigators, if this was me, I would get in contact with that person and get their help getting those answers. That's part of their job description."
Mountainclimbing91,I think second opinion means moving to a new hospital in my opinion. My mom is currently being taken care of at sloan kettering. The only one i know that would examine your case remotely would be the cleveland clinic out in ohio. I don’t know I would just call the doctors office. You could request another one but it may also be the same.
Anon-567890,"I lived clean. Never smoked, ate right, worked out regularly. When I got diagnosed with stage IV adeno my oncologist said it’s becoming more common in female non-smokers and they don’t know why. I quit asking because it doesn’t serve me to ask. By the way, that was 9 years ago. Focus on treatment and maintaining health! Sorry you’re here in this sub and your mom is lucky to have you! We are here for you"
Party_Author_9337,"I was 38 when I was diagnosed, non smoker. I wish I could blame it on stress. But we don’t know why it’s more common"
Blueporch,"My sister was diagnosed recently. Never smoked, ate right, exercised her whole life. She thinks there’s probably genetic component based on our family history. We’re still all in shock about this. But after joining this sub, I’ve seen so many people with no lifestyle factors who have been diagnosed."
egfrcarer2023,I am sorry to hear what you are going through. My partner has s4 lung cancer. She never smoked. 1 in 3 women who get lung cancer are non smokers. They have a higher chance of having a genetic mutations related to lung cancer. My partner is EGFR mutation positive and responded to targeted therapy.
Patchouli061017,So sorry about your partner. Just for people reading this .. most mutations in lung cancer are not inherited but are somatic mutations (meaning damage that occurs throughout one’s life time).. not passed on. They are trying to figure out if there are any other genetics that predispose people without risk factors to lung cancer but mutations such as EGFR ALK RET aren’t typically inherited .. genomic mutations vs genetic
Winter-Calendar6393,If you mother lived in houses most of her life- Look into Radon Gas exposure… that causes alot of lung cancers!
MindlessParsley1446,YES! 2nd leading cause is Radon!
Patchouli061017,Lung cancer in never smokers is on the rise they don’t really know why
Patchouli061017,This recent webinar does a nice job explaining it:https://gkc.go2.org/pages/inherit-study
BikerMike03RK,"I'm sure that it's a factor that weakens the body's resistance to disease. My wife died of lung cancer, 22 days after it was discovered, on May 9th, this year. Married for 45 years, lived together for 48."
Junior-University-38,Sounds like my in-law because she was the same way I’m so sorry to hear about your mom
Virgo_54,"I highly recommend this article. It explains why lung cancer is becoming so common in non-smokers. Really helpful after my NSCLC diagnosis. All the Carcinogens We Cannot See We routinely test for chemicals that cause mutations. What about the dark matter of carcinogens—substances that don’t create cancer cells but rouse them from their slumber? By Siddhartha Mukherjee The New Yorker Magazine December 11, 2023"
CancerCareRN,That is one of the many factors that can contribute to cancer. Stress can cause havoc in the body and lower our immune system.
MiaWallacetx,My brother was non smoking ski instructor when he was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer at the age of 35. His was caused by a genetic mutation.
Comprehensive_Chef18,"I’m another never smoker, healthy until I suddenly wasn’t at 46. Diagnosed with stage IV. ALK+ mutation and currently doing well. I have tried to figure out what caused this because I had always been pretty healthy. No clue why it happened in my body. I have been LIVING with stage IV for almost 3 years now snd am so grateful more as no more attention is being given to lung cancer."
wanderer0479,"I’m 41, Male, Stage IV. Never smoked, exercised regularly, and had a healthy organic foods diet. Was diagnosed back in 2020. Currently on clinical trial as entrectinib, lorbrena (lorlatinib) and chemo no longer works. Never really knew how i got it, but would be great to get additional information from those who’s been dealing with this longer than I have."
ExcitingDegree,"Just wanted to say congratulations and thank you for sharing, so happy that your doctors have found the proper treatment to get this under control. How are you feeling? It has to feel good to see progress."
rollerG12,"I feel pretty good, for a couple of reasons. Firstly, I was told that I’m early in treatment so we aren’t even necessarily expecting shrinkage because the immunotherapy may not have had enough time to begin working yet. So I am very happy to see a response already, I am hoping that this is a good sign for long term results. Second, through my lung cancer journey I have been reading about how new genetic mutations and targeted therapy are “changing the game” for lung cancer treatment and how it’s saving lives. However, I have found way less hopeful insight around treatment for patients that do not have these targetable mutations, and I do not have any of these mutations so I was worried that treatment would be less effective for me. I almost felt left out and like I had less hope. I am hoping that I will have some continued success with treatment and can provide hope for patients who don’t have targeted therapy and have to stick with the standard chemo/immunotherapy. Overall, we are not out of the woods yet, but for how early I am in treatment I think this is a very good response and we wouldn’t be expecting much more this early on based on what I discussed with my care team."
Flashy-Pomegranate96,"There is an Aussie company, immunotep working on a drug effi that allows the immune checkpoint inhibitors to work on solid tumors that do not express the pd-l1, or whose tumors have less than 1% pd-1. They don’t usually work in those cases, especially nsclc. It only in clinical trials now (trial is tacti-002). There may soon be some big breakthroughs in cancer, good luck and good to see you making progress."
MindlessParsley1446,Fantastic news!! Congratulations 😊❤️
Blueporch,That’s wonderful news!
frostbike,Great news!
Pretty-Narwhal-3313,Great news! Thank you for putting this out there. Love to hear about the positive outcomes & victory over some of this!
Due-Emu4273,Congratulations on the results! I just read your comment on my post about how you were typing your response while in the waiting room for your updated scans. I’m glad it went well! Keep me updated with your journey as it brings me hope and joy 💕

Yourstrulysandy,Congrats! My mom has NSCLC with RET mutation and we are on her 2nd line of targeted therapy as the first line only worked for 3 months
Tinyanonimouse,Whoooooo hoooooo !! I am so happy for you !
ttbap,Hearty congratulations!! Many thanks for sharing. This helps inspire a lot of people.
ssjesses,Congrats!
EcstaticAd2743,Wonderful! Keep on keepin’ on! 👏🏻
HarveyMushman72,"I did 3 or 4 chemotherapy sessions to shrink the tumor that was on/near a major artery on the upper right lobe, once that was out of the way, they removed my right upper lobe and I came back with clear margins. I was in the hospital for 5 days. I don't know if this helps since everyone is different. I didn't need oxygen (you might, idk) and I live at an elevation of 5,000 feet."
Rblsoul,Thanks for the info
Bama-1970,"Look in to RATS lung cancer surgery. I spent two days in the hospital. No oxygen after surgery. If it’s an option, you will have a faster recovery and less scarring (3 small incisions, 1 for camera, 2 for instruments)."
Cari8309,"I’ve had upper lobes in both of my lungs they removed all of the cancer and then it was in lymph nodes both times. The first time I had 4 rounds of chemo. Then it came back, had 4 rounds of chemo now on Keytruda for a yr. Never needed oxygen I’m 58 live in Pa"
Pretty-Narwhal-3313,"How are you doing with Keytruda? I had a lulobectomy, 4 rounds chemo & radiation. Now recovering from post radiation pneumonitis & considering keytruda in the fall if my lungs can recover. I have had SOB with exertion since the surgery. Not on oxygen at all. Concerned the immune therapy will make breathing worse. I staged at 111a."
Rblsoul,Thanks-hope you’re doing well
Limp_Trick_1011,"If dr says surgery is an option, take it without any second thoughts."
Old_n_Bald,"16 months ago I was diagnosed with stage 4, right upper lobe cancer with secondaries in my colon and adrenal gland. I thought my days were numbered. I had 3 rounds of chemo-immunotherapy, which completely got rid of the secondaries and shrunk the primary, which was then surgically removed. I had very minimal side effects from surgery, no oxygen, minimal pain, and was in hospital for 3 days. Had to sleep sitting upright in a recliner for about a week. I'm now 6 months with no evidence of disease. Immunotherapy was difficult and made me really tired and nauseous. It has also given me Acute Kidney Injury, but I see all that as a price worth paying for where I am now. Maybe I have been lucky, and if I have, I hope you are twice as lucky as me. Stay positive. It really helps."
Intelligent-Tank-180,I have this but chose hospice not letting any dr touch me ever again Glad u r doing well
Rblsoul,I wish you well
Party_Author_9337,I had a lobectomy for my lung cancer. I was never offered radiation. I am glad the tumor was removed. I also had like 20 lymph nodes removed and biopsied.
Rblsoul,Thank you for the reply
nothinmatress95,"My dad had a lobectomy (left, lower) clear margins. He had another tumour in his jaw, for which the doctor said we should do radiation. The radiation didn't work and when we had the tumour surgically removed, the radiation had impacted the blood circulation in the region so badly that the surgery site wouldn't heal. Many post surgical complications nearly took away months of necessary treatment. Ask your doctors about surgery on irradiated skin, if radiation doesn't work and you ultimately have to do the surgery."
Rblsoul,I will-thanks
BuytheTickets,"I opted for surgery because I was healthy enough for it. It may sound macabre, but I’m hedging my bets against future cancers where radiation may be the only option."
Rblsoul,I’m the opposite lol-even a month laid up during the summer takes away my time to ride and camp -so I’m doing radiation now and do the surgery later if I need to-have my first appointment to talk with him today so I’ll see how it goes
Economy-Specific6419,Was diagnosed in nov 2023 stage 4 nsclc. Compression of my t12 vertebrae so had major back pain. On the mri in the emergency room they found right lower lobe a 5cm mass. First biopsy was inconclusive and did another one in my lung and also did biomarker. I had ros 1 biomarkers and a candidate for target therapy. Had spine surgery on Christmas Eve. Started target therapy on Jan 11. Now I am pretty much back to my old self. In January before target therapy my weight was 130lbs now I am back to 190lbs and working out 4 times a week. Lung cancer therapy has come a long way. My oncologist said if this was before 2018 I wouldn’t make it. Get the biomarkers done asap. Radiation therapy will help tremendously with the cancer of the vertebrae. Good luck.
pilarofsociety,"Thank you, I really appreciate this. What was the trajectory like in the days after starting radio, e.g. did you feel worse before feeling better? She has bone destruction at c5 and L5. I just want her to feel a bit better so she can see there is hope."
Wyde1340,"I was dx December 2018 Stage 4 squamous non-small cell with MET amplification biomarker. I'm doing very well on targeted therapy. I have no side effects now (I did when I first started, but onco gave me meds then reduced my dosage). Trust me when I say this: I was close to death...in a wheelchair, dependent on others, wearing diapers. Then I started the targeted therapy. Within 2 weeks, I was able to function again. I know not everyone will have this outcome, but please let her know there's hope."
pilarofsociety,"Thank you for your story, that gives me a lot of hope."
BiotechBay,Non-smoking East Asian women very commonly have EGFR mutant cancer which is very treatable. I would see if you can get a consult earlier to get her started on targeted therapy. I have a family member that was barely able to walk and after starting treatment was back to almost normal.
pilarofsociety,"She’s in NI and it’s public holidays until Tuesday frustratingly. She was told maybe she’ll see the oncologist a week later, but it’s very vague. I’m very frustrated by the whole process (NHS) but appreciate it can be a whole lot worse."
hey_luh,"I am so sorry for your mom. I think you need to be prepared for losing her. It's not easy, but it will bring you comfort. You should study palliative care also. Palliative care is for terminal patients, it helps to manage their pain. Because even when there is no treatment available, there is something to do: we can manage their pain and try treatments for the tumor don't grow anymore. When we don't have much experience with cancer we are used to think that stage 4 is the end, but even in the end there is plenty of things to do. Some patients even with mets can live to 3 years. I have seen one that even wrote a book ! She had mets in the liver, terminal cancer, and did dance classes. Besides that, nowadays palliative care is recommended to everyone who has a disease that threatens the life, even when it's still treatment available. Palliative care helps us to understand death and how to bring comfort for our loved ones. They teach us how to manage the physical pain of our loved ones, how to prepare them and how to enjoy every minute that we have left. I know it's hard but you have to try. Don't cancel your flight. She will need you there. A lot of patients said that they don't want their families, because they are afraid of family gets desperate and make things worst. But deep down, they need their family. Also, if you can, go see her now. She may be going, but even when we are going, there is plenty things to do. You can talk to her, you can watch movies with her and do little things that she likes. Try to act normal around her. Make her smile. I think that studying palliative care will help you a lot to understand what to do and how to manage the situation with your mother. (it helps me with my dad, he has mets in his lungs) This book ""Death is a day that worth living"" helped me a lot. I hope it will help you too."
frostbike,"As others have said, get the biomarker testing done. I was diagnosed last fall, stage 4 with mets in multiple bones and lymph nodes. Within a couple months of the diagnosis I lost 25 pounds, couldn’t walk without a cane (and a lot of pain), and my main tumor grew so fast it was pressing against the blood vessels that supply my heart, which resulted in a 3 day hospital stay. I have an ALK mutation, and have been doing targeted therapy for 8 months. I can walk and do most daily activities now. I’m still dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath, but it’s a 180 degree turnaround from where I was. Even if she doesn’t have a targetable mutation, chemo and immunotherapy have come a long way."
pilarofsociety,"Thank you, I’m glad you’re feeling better. They’re doing the gene mutation testing and I’m hopeful for EGFR as she’s an east Asian non-smoker. I just need to get that oncologist appt asap."
InclinationCompass,"It’s really likely (over 50%) she has one of the EGFR mutations based on her demographics, which there are effective drugs for. Is it possible her onc sends in her sample for biomarkers testing while she’s doing radiotherapy? They might be able to use the same tissue sample taken during the biopsy I would try to reach out to them and ask"
Patchouli061017,If she has a targetable mutation like EGFR .. and gets on right treatment she could start to feel so much better within days 🤍
akron-mike,"She will probably get cold. I can't speak for your treatment center. Mine was well prepared for everything I needed. I brought reading material but ended up having a tv on and talking with my wife through the 1st half. 2nd half was sleeping and peeing. It's a miserable time. Day 1 after chemo was pretty good, steroid fueled. Day 2 is a bitch."
Anon-567890,"You get in a “chemo rhythm.” First one it’s hard to know what to expect. And everyone’s side effects will be different, so keeping a chemo journal will allow her to know that, maybe, by day 5 she can walk more, or by day 10 she gets her appetite back (whatever her side effects are). That way she can kind of know what to expect each round. I was always able to work the day after (probably because all those steroids), but by Saturday evening the “darkness” descended. But always know there is light after the darkness. Always! Hope she tolerates everything with as few side effects as possible! 🤍🤍"
Drunktrucker,"The anticipation of a difficult event is usually worse than the actual experience for me, but I tend to ‘catastrophize or so I’ve been told. Best wishes for an uneventful day. Your mom is lucky to have your support."
onehundredpetunias,"Starting therapy is, in many ways a relief. It's so hard knowing that the cancer is there and being in control of nothing. Starting the chemo is at least something. Just relax and be there for/with her. It's hard to absorb everything so it's good that she has someone there to help remember information. Make sure you know when/how/who to call with any questions afterwards."
Melwaukee17,"You’re so right. We’re “excited” to finally be doing something since the cancer was caught so tragically late. So doing something feels better than nothing. I will definitely be her eyes and years. And you’re right, figuring out who to call and when is half the battle. Learning that the healthcare system is beyond not a smooth oiled machine is, adding to the compounded stress."
MindlessParsley1446,"When I went through chemo once/week via IV infusions of Carbo/Taxol, I made sure to drink plenty of water in order to help prep my veins for the IV as well as to help flush out my system. I brought and iPod with earbuds so I could listen to music. I went alone each time, and didn't want to hear any other noise from my surroundings there (peace of mind, I suppose). They did provide me blankets and snacks, which was so nice. I taped the ""instruction sheet"" to my fridge at home so my family would know what to watch for, as far as side effects/fever, etc, and the phone number to call if we needed help or had ANY questions. 😊 I'm praying for an uneventful experience for you and your mom. She's gonna be okay ❤️"
ssjesses,"Make sure she eats something before and maybe take snack for during the treatment. A hoodie and blanket if she gets cold, a book if she likes to read, maybe download a movie she might like to watch. Day 1 wasn’t so bad for my mom, she said she thought it would be worse. For after, make sure she moisturizes and use lip balm. The moogoo brand was the one my mom liked best for shower gel and moisturizer, lanolips for her lips, they got super dry. Her hair didn’t really start falling out until 2 to 3 weeks after the first treatment but everyone is different. Good luck!"
BreakfastInfinite116,"My dad does carbo/opdivo & yervoy every 3 weeks. The first treatments are the hardest, in my opinion, because you just don't know what to expect. Once she's gone through a round or two, you'll feel a bit more prepared. Before and after infusions, make sure she drinks a ton of water, clear fluids and electrolytes! If she's cold, sipping warm broth or soup is great. This helps flush out the residual meds and dead cancer cells after treatment, and can help prevent constipation. In our experience, the symptoms tend to be worse if my dad doesn't drink enough hydrating fluids. Try to avoid coffee or caffeine until after the infusions, especially if she doesn't have a port. We learned the hard way that it can make it more difficult to find veins. 😬 The first day or two likely won't be too bad because they'll give anti-nausea meds and steroids. For my dad's treatments, we have what we call the ""Dreaded Day 4"" which is usually when those wear off and he hits a brick wall of aches and fatigue. He now plans his treatments so that by day 3 or 4, he'll have a couple of days off to just rest and nap. Whenever she is feeling well enough try to take her on some walks, even if its only 10 minutes, and do some sort of light weight lifting or stretching. The last thing you really think about is making sure they workout, but it can actually help recovery and maintaining muscle is important during treatment."
Party_Author_9337,The chemo days will have you at the infusion center almost all day. Be prepared to hurry up and wait. Usually the access the port and draw labs. Wait for the lab results. Then wait for in the drugs to be prepared. My oncologist would hydrate me with a bag of IV fluids and nausea medication before the chemo started. My first round was probably the easiest with the fatigue. But the hardest for nausea. It hit about day 3 or 4. I only ate watermelon and pretzels. After the first round we found out what nausea meds worked. By day seven I felt better.
mgsalinger,Lots of water. Pro- biotics and let the doctors know of any side effects early - the more in front of them you can get the better. Exercise really helps me through the treatments.
WalkingHorse,Thinking of you today! Hope it all goes smoothly. Hydrate hydrate hydrate and rest. 🤍
Melwaukee17,"Thank you! Went as well as it could. We have the day one steroid energy right now, so hoping the crash isn’t too hard. She’s drinking plenty!"
behindthelens83,My mom is on this combo. First chemo treatment went fine with no side effects. They added Keytruda during the second treatment and she developed a fever and infection 48 hours later. Be prepared for some side effects and alert her care team if you see any. She might also need frequent blood transfusions as chemo can cause RBC and hemo to go down.
Melwaukee17,Thank you for the insight. From all my reading it seems completely 50/50 on whether Keytruda is a ‘miracle’ or extremely detrimental. Hoping my mom gets the lucky half. Keeping your mom in my thoughts also. Seeing moms in pain absolutely sucks.
affenage,"The stats of cancer reoccurring are not perfect, you have a much higher risk of a second cancer than the general population. It’s a clinical trial, meaning they think this may be helpful, but they do not know for certain. It is entirely up to you.. and I completely understand both choices. I am getting a 10 mm nodule that lit up in a Pet scan removed and biopsied in the next couple of weeks. If they offered me a trial with an immuno drug that would work with my cancer I think I would do it. I have had two previous separate cancers, so I know my luck with getting cancer sucks."
JJRasmatazz,Thank you.
TrashPandaNotACat,"I was in a similar position - stage 1a3 tumor in left upper lobe, deemed nonoperable due to diminished lung capacity in right lung from emphysema. Treated with radiation, all signs point to tumor killed, and offered spot in immunotherapy clinical trial to see about using durvalumab to prevent reoccurance. Mine is a double blind study, where I dont know if I'm getting the placebo or the real drug. I opted to do it, despite the possible side effects, because it can come back and because it means they'll be keeping a much closer eye on me than if I wasnt in trial. I get a CT more frequently, PET scans more frequently, and meet with oncologist more frequently. Because of this more frequent testing, we caught 2 large colon polyps right before they became cancerous (they lit up on PET scan, but were declared precancerous when removed and tested). So, that keeping a closer eye on things has already paid off (I'm a little over a year into the trial). Is the flying to Houston every 4 weeks for my clinical trial a bit of a pain? Yes. Is it worth it? For me, yes."
Anon-567890,You are a warrior! Thank you for advancing the science!!
TrashPandaNotACat,Another thing to keep in mind - you can drop out of the trial at any time.
Anon-567890,"I’d get a second, maybe third opinions from oncologists."
JJRasmatazz,Thank you
Drunktrucker,"I had the same surgery in October 2022, I had a 1.5 cm adenocarcinoma , stage 1A, my surgeon sent me to an oncologist who just had me have ct scans every 6 months for a year and a half and after the one last month came back no evidence of recurrence he said see ya in a year."
bobolly,Keytruda Can help. It's really up to how your body receives it. Reoccurrence is really what gets people in trouble. My mom was on it and she did not have many side effects. Radiation for her what's the worst. Are they letting you skip chemo And radiation since you had surgery?
missmypets,"Each of us here is today because someone, somewhere in time had a treatment or a surgery not knowing if the outcome would mean survival or not. You have to decide if you want to pay it forward or not. No judgement either way. As you said, do you want to risk side effects for no benefit or is it possible that other new cancers could result from your 40 year history and you might be preventing them? It's a very difficult decision and should not be made lightly."
Limp_Trick_1011,"I do not know the details, the exact stage of your tumor, but for 1 cm solid tumor with nothing else involved (presumably stage 1A1) I never heard of imunotherapy. Also, for certain markers, as EGFR, imuno is not a choice. Maybe they try smth new, that's why it is a trial, but I would ask the oppinion of other dr too, and those dr should be oncologists, not surgeons."
BreakfastInfinite116,"My understanding is that everyone has circulating cancer cells that the immune system regularly attacks. Cancer develops when, at some point, some of those cells mutate and/or the immune system can no longer kill them. Removing the tumor can be part of the solution and for many people it's enough, but there is a greater chance of a secondary cancer forming somewhere down the road. The thought behind immunotherapy is to ramp up your immune system to be able to kill those cells, but I've seen it go both ways. For some, the side effects are incredibly harsh and for others, not so much. You could also research some natural diet and lifestyle changes to support your body and immune system if you choose not to do keytruda. It's an incredibly tough decision to make, I wish you the best! ❤️"
Wyde1340,"I don't know if you're a Facebook user, but there are a ton of support groups there. https://www.facebook.com/groups/1643271995958004/?ref=share&mibextid=qtnXGe EGFR Resisters: https://www.facebook.com/groups/EGFRResisters/?ref=share&mibextid=qtnXGe I've seen papers that EGFR is fairly common in Asian women, but I don't know enough about it. I am currently an Imerman Angel to an Asian woman, around your Mom's age, with EGFR as well. I have squamous nsclc with MET mutation and I've been stable for over 5 years. Let her know there is hope!"
pilarofsociety,"Thanks for your reply. I’m in EGFR resisters and it’s very informative. This is for when we have the exact mutation information - but is there a resource on prognosis by mutation? For example, the prognosis for those with mutations that can be targeted must be better than for those without."
missmypets,Those papers are quite accurate. There are studies seeking to understand the underlying genetic reason for the prevalence of EGFR in Asian women. Sending an abundance of hope that they get the results swiftly and that a TKI will work well for her.
BiotechBay,EGFR mutant lung cancer is one of the the more common cancers among non-smoking east Asian females. The good news is that the targeted therapies are very effective with low side effects. This is not a cure but it can stabilize the disease for a while.
Ok_Ride176,"My mom is not of Chinese decent but she has stage 4 Adenocarcinoma to her right lung, EGFR exon 18 mutation. Also non smoker, she was put on Tagrisso oral pill daily and life expectancy of hopefully 5 years, it’s only been 3 months and she’s lost significant amount of weight but drs say she’s doing ok so far!"
pilarofsociety,Thank you for this. Did they say prognosis for Tagrisso is 5 years?
pilarofsociety,"UPDATE: My mum saw her oncologist today who said she has EGFR exon 21 L858R mutation, plus a rare ILE706THR mutation. She’s starting Tagrisso next week assuming her blood tests are normal. The doctor said Tagrisso works on average for 2 years but varies. In the circumstances, I think this is positive. I hope everyone else is doing ok."
Unlikely-Slide6402,"This is incredible. Thank you for sharing this, I really, really needed this today and I am so, SO happy that you are in a good place in your journey. You’re an incredibly strong and motivated person! My mom is in Stage 4 now, after being diagnosed last year at stage 2b, having a lobectomy, then 4 rounds of chemo, followed by immunotherapy. She was lucky to have 6 months of NED, but a recent MRI just showed a brain tumor, so they removed it and she is doing remarkably well! Released after just one day after the surgery, she’s already able to do light chores and the surgery was just 4 days ago! I asked them to do biomarker testing because I am hoping for the outcome you are describing!! This was wonderful to read, though I know there have been some VERY tough moments for you along the way. Keep kicking ass! ♥️ You’re amazing"
Anon-567890,Thank you for your kind words! I’m grateful that your mother is doing so well after her brain surgery! I’ve never dealt with that yet. I’m glad the timing of posting my story helped you! Please share my story of hope with your mom!! Hugs! 🤍🤍
Wyde1340,I'm glad you're still here and enjoying life! Your story gives hope to all of us. Sending you positive thoughts that Enhertu works and works for a long time!
jddigitalchaos,"Yeah, I have the HER2 mutation too. Dx last October at 41 and started Enhertu last March after immunotherapy failed. PET scan almost 2 months ago showed complete metabolic response (no cancer activity after just 3 treatments)! Dr says I'll be on this treatment rest of my life as long as it keeps working since I'm stage 4 (spread to brain and adrenals). Make sure to get echocardiograms regularly as it can affect the heart! Last echo showed my heart was being affected, so they delayed treatment for 4 weeks to see if my heart recovers before continuing."
SnooRobots8351,This is so inspiring. My dad has also diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. And he just finished his second round of chemo and will do a CT scan to see if it works. Both my mum and I felt so overwhelmed since the diagnosis. And we just feel like we don’t know what will happen next. Thanks for your advice to be patient and grateful 🙂
missmypets,Thank you for sharing. Your story will bring much hope to others.
Anon-567890,Thank YOU for all you do for all of us here! 🤍
Patchouli061017,"Wow amazing ! Thank you for sharing ! Do you have her2 mutation , amplification , or over expression?"
Anon-567890,Thanks to the anonymous Kind Redditor for the award! 🥰🤍🥰🤍
AnnualTeach5232,My husband has stage 4 adenocarcinoma diagnosed in February 2024. We both are physical therapists. He did 4 rounds of chemo and immunotherapy with no luck. He started HER2 Thursday of this last week. You guys could be twins. Hoping like you that this new treatment kicks his cancers ass. I really appreciate your contribution this sub.
Purple_Olive_5358,"Thank you so much for sharing your journey, may I asked which stage was it was found?"
Anon-567890,I felt lymph nodes on the left side of my neck. No other symptoms. Already stage IV at diagnosis. So surgery wasn’t on the table.
CharacterLeather3584,Thank you for sharing this. I’m early in my stage IV adenocarcinoma journey. I am supposed to get my last chemo (for now) next week. Your story gives me hope.
Anon-567890,"I hope you get good results from the chemo. No fun, and it’s difficult to focus on the good when all seems bad, but I’ve been lucky to be in the light after the darkness! I wish you the best! We are here for you! 🤍🤍🤍"
OkShape6491,Thank you for the update and for your kind contributions to this sub! 🩷 I hope that your current medication keeps you NED for longer than before! 🌸
Anon-567890,Thank you for these kind words! Been on the struggle bus this week because I haven’t had chemo in so long and I kinda forgot what a challenge it is! Hopefully I’ll be feeling better soon! 🤍
Anon-567890,Usually radiation helps with the bone pain
AnnualTeach5232,Came here to say this.
AnnualTeach5232,Husband same diagnosis. Diagnosed in February. Wait for bio markers. They will guide treatment. Lots of progress in this field. Stay positive. Hugs to you and mom
pilarofsociety,"Thank you, same to you ❤️"
[deleted],My mom had a very similar diagnosis. Large right lung mass and a secondary mass pushing into her esophagus/vertebrate Radiation helped immensely with the mass that was pushing against her esophagus/back and it ultimately didn’t come back. One key thing to advocate for is pain relief. My mom was a trooper and I wish I was able to convince her to go on stronger pain relief sooner for her quality of life.
pilarofsociety,"Thanks so much for this. What did the doctor say to you about the prognosis, if you don’t mind me asking? My mum is such a trooper too. So unnecessarily. She won’t even take paracetamol during the day, so she does take something for night time."
InclinationCompass,ask for a biomarkers test after the biopsy results come back
olivelove-,my mom has the same diagnosis with a spot on her spine too. they radiated it and it was successful. her pain is gone now
pilarofsociety,Thank you for this. It’s comforting. How long/many treatments did it take for the pain to go?

InterestingLook646,"I am 36f with three children. 19, 17 and 14. I was diagnosed with NSCLC in 2022 and was given 3 years as well. I'm telling you as a mother she wants you to be happy. Please find joy in the small things at first. Because when it seems like there's nothing to be happy about there are small things. Morning coffee or evening tea. Your favorite dessert. Summer rain or the beautiful sound of birds chirping. Seriously the small things add up and if you take the time to appreciate them, then you can have happy days. Please use your life to the fullest. She would definitely want you to. I pray my children can move on and not make my death the catalyst that defines the rest of their life. That would be the worst thing I can think of."
Other-Pangolin8106,Thank you so much really. I’m hoping and praying for you. ❤️
Jmtb3601,"As a mom who was just diagnosed with NSCLC, I would want you to be happy and please go back to school. She would want that for you. Carry all the good memories you made with her always and try talking about those. If she was in hospice, some counseling should be provided to the family for the first year afterwards; please find out and take advantage of that to help you deal with the painful experiences you witnessed. If not, I’m sure others in the group can provide other counseling options. You really need to seek out professionals who can help you."
Dry-Ant-9485,"People are shitty when you lose a parent, when I lost my dad every one was all around offering support for the first few weeks, then nothing and I understand what you mean people want to avoid difficult situations. It’s normal how you are feeling you have been through intensely traumatic experiences I would recommend some specialist ptsd therapy and some CBT after. Medication for a short while should also help things balance out, but 4 months is early days and your feelings are normal your brain has to figure it all out and then your body which will be in a state of fight or flight should settle down. But don’t panic about school, take your time to process however I do think it may be an excellent way to honour your mother and yourself I used education as my coping mechanism by working supper hard (my father couldnt read or write) so it was very important for him we had an education, I used my love and respect for them to make them proud and these also have built my confidence. But at 19 there is no huge rush, first thing is get some support from your doctors it will help you understand your emotions and deal with the medical trauma you witnessed. There isn’t a day that goes by that I don’t think about him and try my best to honour him, people say times a healer it’s not for me, what helped me was professionals and medication as I also didn’t have a support network, do you have any other family members who you can lean on ? But I promise you that you have entered a very special group of people who after loosing a parent never ever take anything for granted you cherish the moments and you will become more resilient and loving than you ever imagined, you clearly are already an amazing human by stopping school to care for your mum is top level decent human status. But be kind and let yourself feel these emotions they will come and go and eventually you will learn to navigate them. But I am so proud of you and I know your mum is too, take it easy feel free to DM"
radionet1,"You were and are your mom's Angel. Always remember that. I urge you to seek grief counseling. Look for grief pages here in reddit and please share your story as it is special, unique and inspiring for and to others."
Cynical498,"Sorry for your loss. I already read the best advice I can give. Remember they wouldn’t want you to be sad. I’ve been telling myself that for over three years now, and I HATE telling myself that, but it needs to happen or I will obsess and sink into a depression. It’s probably not so much as people don’t want to talk about her, they just don’t know how to do it. They don’t want to upset you and the best way to avoid that subject entirely. It’s okay for you to bring it up though. It lets them know you want to talk about it!"
hey_luh,"I am so sorry for your lost. My dad is in treatment for 5 years. Now he has a lot of mets, and I am his care giver too. He's not dead, but day after day he gets worse and I know that it's time to say goodbye. I didn't have family to help me (only my mom who does not get along with my dad), my friends all disappeared because I was not fun anymore and no one wants to talk about death. People avoid thinking about death, because they think that avoiding this death doesn't exist. So I think I understand how you must be felling (I don't have anyone, just my mom). I know it's hard, specially when we are alone. Our parents are our best friends (my dad is my whole world, and I think your mother it was your whole world too). And no one wants to live without our best friends. Life looses its colors, specially when we are young (I am 22, so l get it how you must be feeling). But something that I've learned studying palliative care all those years is that we never lost the one we loved. Even when they are not here, they will always be in our heart and in our memories. Our parents literally made us, they are in our DNA, they are in our qualities and also in our defaults.Your mother may be not be here physically, but she is inside you. You are her legacy. And you should live to pass forward her qualities, to be a strong and amazing human being. Don't be the person who thinks that now that your person is gone, everything is over. It's not. Your mother is still alive in your heart and inside you. She is alive when you are strong, she will be alive when you conquer things (because everything you will conqu it's because of the qualities that she taught you). She is alive when you listen her favorite song, and when you do thinas that she likes. Thinking this wav helps me a lot with my dad. I know that when he goes, he will always be inside me. He will be inside me when I watch car races (because he always loved car races). He is inside me when I learn Italian (he always wanted to learn how to speak Italian), when I listen 80's songs (He always loved 80's band, and I listen them all the time) and when I persist in my goals (he created me to be fighter and not the person who just does not have an opinion). Doing things that he likes, breathing the air that he wanted me to breathe, help me to realize that he will always live inside me. Maybe this will help you to keep your mom always around. I also learn in palliative care that when your person dies, your life will never be the same, but this doesn't mean that will always be unhappy. because that is not what our loved ones would want. Your mother would want that you would be happy. That you would go back to school and made your life, build new projects (a career, or having a family). That you fulfill your life with other happiness. I know it's hard to think about new projects when literally your whole world fell apart, but with time, you will rebuild your life and make an extraordinary life. You are stronger than most people. A lot of kids in your place would just give up, they couldn't stand give u school and being the care giver, but you didn't. Anc. is amazing. You will have the strength to make a new life and make your mother proud (and alive inside you). Besides that, the book Death is a day worths living, helped me a lot. I think you should read, and try counseling, grief therapy (individual or in group) it's helpful too. Talking to a psychologist helps you to understand your grief and move on with your life. If you need someone to talk to, please feel free to send me a DM."
Purple_Olive_5358,"I'm so sorry for your loss and send you prayers 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻, and I agree with the other person replying, your mom would want you to be happy and go back to school, I think it's still too soon to not be hurting 🥺 Can I respectfully ask you, how did they find out she had cancer and which stage?"
gtzbr478,You are very strong and it’s so young to have to go through all you’ve gone through. Your feelings are valid and it takes time to sort it all out. Big hugs
Wee_Baillie,Sorry to hear about the loss of your mum! So much good advice in the comments that I would recommend as well. Your mum would have been so proud how strong and supporting you were in her time of need and you should be so proud of yourself. It’s natural to grieve and feel the way you are ❤️ please take care of yourself.
Legal_Piano_9402,Look up Griefshare . Sorry 🙏 .
Odd-Vanilla-9025,"That is heartbreaking, I will have you in my prayers and thoughts and hope that God heals your wounds. Know that God has something planned for you , you were the best gift a mother could ask for , you helped her heal and go in peace. You were by her side , I bet she felt so lucky to have such a beautiful Angel by her side ❤️"
Other-Pangolin8106,Thank you so so much. 😭💜
PopsiclesForChickens,"The only good thing about any part of my cancer diagnosis and treatment was my husband. Married 17 years with 3 school age kids when I was diagnosed last year with stage 3 colorectal cancer. It was terrible, but he wasn't, he was and still is wonderful (I've been in remission since December). He let me cry to him after our kids were in bed almost every night last year, went with me to every doctor appointment he could, took time off after surgery to help me. And has been very patient and understanding with me as I've been pretty depressed and angry. We didn't have a lot of support. We see his family maybe once a year, my family decided me having cancer freaked them out too much to come around, and his best friends were unfortunately no help or support for him. I still feel bad that I had him and a couple of good friends, but he really had no one."
uhlvin,"He had you, babe."
feathernose,"At first, the stress really got to him. And me. It was very hard. He didnt choose to be with someone who has cancer, right? We had our issues but every time we pushed on through. He took care of me. I took care of him whenever i had tiny bit of energy left. We had 1 or 2 moments where we almost broke up. It was hard for both of us. It was 6 years ago - after treatment the cancer came back 2 years later. Treatment again. Guess what? 2 years later the cancer came back AGAIN. Finished surgery and chemo a few months ago. Its still hard sometimes because the relationship feels unbalanced because he has much more energy than me. But he is okay with that. He takes care for me and before my chemo he told me he really wanted to fight this battle together as a team. So it took us some years to find a way to manage our lives together and still be happy and have fun together. We now focus on the good moments together, building a lot of good memories. If you wanna talk i'm here for you."
Egoy,"My wife is a trooper and she stuck by my side every step of the way. I won’t use the cliche of how I ‘couldn’t have done it without her’ because I could have, but it would have sucked sooooo much more."
Nodes420,My fiancé is the glue that holds me together. Without her I’d imagine I’d be in a deep depression. It’s not easy on either of us but the fact that I wake up in my chemo chair / bed to see her there smiling back at me telling me I’m gonna make it literally keeps me alive.
Glass-Vermicelli9862,Well we been through a lot when I lost my job and when she lost hers. The treatment was terrible and I be honest she kinda made it bad a lot of times. I give some examples. Chemo and radiation it happened a few times not just once. When I was going to surgery our ride ended up getting covid well instead of her driving or me she begged her brother to take us. (Surgery) When it was snowing and not bad she wouldn't let me leave to get treatment. She was like wait for snow to stop well it did like 4 hours later and the roads where worse. I also had to call in for work that day. (Radiation) I was getting sick from chemo and she knows that bacon really bothers me even the smell does. Well she did it a few times where I woke up just to go throw up. I told her can she please not cook bacon or anything like that during chemo. (Chemo)
LolAtAllOfThis,"My Honey is a bladder cancer survivor. We've only been together for 5 years, but when I was diagnosed, he guided me through unknown territory. He's been right by my side, even through times when I might have been short with him for no reason. I was tired a lot. I still am, but he understands. It's an incredibly long journey. I'm so grateful for him."
Full_Spell297,"I am 53 and he is 50, together for 16 years, married for 14 as of this month. Early this year I was diagnosed with breast cancer. We scheduled my chemo days for the his regular day off from work every week. He would bring me to the infusion center, so they could access my port and draw blood, then we would see the oncologist and review things, then he would help me get settled back at the infusion center for my chemo treatments. He would then leave to run errands and take care of our dogs And I would text him when I was almost finished and he would come and pick me up. We did not take any vacation obviously because of the chemo but also because he wants to use those days to be here for me when I have my surgery. We have tried to get out of the house for something enjoyable, even if it’s just out to lunch Whenever we’re able. I am focusing on recovery even though I still need to have surgery immunotherapy and radiation therapy. I am planning a big party for when I’m cancer free. So whenever we hear a song or think of one, that’s great for dancing. We write it down on a list. We are talking about entertainment options. And I just like the fact that he fully supports me having this party. It will be a victory for both of us. Be open and honest talk about how you feel. Talk about the risks talk about what you wanna do when you’re free and clear, make plans. They may have to be changed, but being actively positive does help you get through it a little bit easier. I recently found out that my tumor did not shrink after five months of chemotherapy and that due to it’s location they might not be able to get all of it so when we meet with my surgeon this week, we have lots of things to discuss. It’s definitely a bummer but we will adapt and do what’s necessary. I wish you all the best and if you wish to contact me, I will do my best to answer."
dammKaren,My husband was great during my cancer treatment. He alway found things for me to do while I sat there he would come and visit during his lunches. Those days are so long. If fact he was better during that time than other times. We married in 1986 and I had cancer in 1999 and again in 2008. And still together now
Huge-Spare-3892,Oooh don’t let me even say it😂I broke up with my bf last month. I just couldn’t be couldn’t be okay with his lack of support 🤷🏽‍♀️it’s hard on us and them but alot of people don’t know how to be there for a person battling cancer I see.
onehundredpetunias,"It changed us- not better or worse, it's just different now. We lost some things and found some new ones. Cancer is stressful. I think it's important to not stress over anything but the most important stuff as much as you can. So if the dirty dishes are left in the sink, I don't sweat it. And I try not to read too much into anything. I give myself and him grace because this stuff is hard."
Lilukalani,"I wouldn't be where I am without my fiance. I've always been sick, and he knew that coming into our relationship. I was actually doing really well for the first half of our first year together, and then I started flaring up and being diagnosed with new things. Once the cancer diagnosis came, it was like old hat. He was scared and worried, but he had my back. He always has my back. I can't count how many times he has helped me bathe or shower or even wipe after going to the bathroom. This man has seen the VILEST things come out of me, all while keeping a straight face and doing his utmost to make me feel human despite everything. I can only hope that others are as lucky as I am. Our relationship isn't perfect, but how he treats me is."
aRealKeeblerElf,"I have cancer and am married. Treatment is hard (we have two kids 6 and 4) but without my husband it would have been so much harder. We both agreed that the sucky part would be temporary and that we’d plow through it! Relationships are always work to some extent. Especially, long ones. You’ll each have ups and downs and hopefully you can lean on each other. How long is your projected treatment vs how long you’ve been together? We’ve been together for over a decade so the last few months are something we can view as “short term.”"
shrlzi,"Good that you are both going to therapy, he needs support too. And that process will help you know if you are 'well-suited' -- It is hard and you are already dealing with a lot of other stress besides Cancer -- My husband was a rock, spent a lot of time at the hospital with me -- his boss was very supportive about flexible work schedule -- did nursing duty when I had to have TPN (tube feeding) at home -- I considered it my 'job' to be appreciative, use my words instead of acting out when I felt grumpy, do what I could to support him. Active listening. I wish you all the best!"
Matelot67,"Ok, here's my story. When I got the diagnosis, my girlfriend came with me to the specialist. When he told me.it was grade 3 prostate cancer, I held it together. She cried. When we left the clinic, she grabbed me, hugged me, then looked in to my eyes with an expression I've never seen before and said... ""That's it, no more excuses, you're moving in with me so we can get through this together."" She's not my girlfriend any more. She's now my wife. This month will be our 8th wedding anniversary. She stuck with me through three years of treatment. We got married while I was still being treated. I've now been cancer free for nearly 7 years. It's a wonderful life."
Amythyst34,"My husband and I have been together for 16 years. Married for 9. When I was diagnosed, he was terrified. His mind went to dark places, understandably. He was scared he was going to wake up one morning and find me dead. He doesn't cry often, but he broke down about this many times, and I comforted him and told him it was going to be okay, despite my own fears and trepidation. But despite that, he has been my rock. He puts on a strong face and goes to every appointment with me. Listens to the doctors and nurses - takes notes on his phone - so when I forget something they said, he has the info. When I went through surgery, he learned how to cook so he could make me food during recovery. That's not to say it's been easy. We've had fights. Always over really stupid stuff. But the stress of all this breaks you down to the point that stupid little things are the breaking point. Remember to show your appreciation of the other person. And don't be too proud to say sorry."
themomfiles,"We were great beforehand, never argued, always in sync. After he became extremely depressed and angry and made some questionable choices. I sought therapy, he refused. We divorced a few years later."
erinmarie777,"Writing about this experience might be therapeutic for you to help you process your emotions. I think your fiancé, family, and friends would appreciate it when you’re gone. (You could also make videos for them). My son has an incurable cancer and he recommended a book called “The Last Lecture”. It was written by a professor who was terminally ill. He has since passed. My son is a philosophy professor and he has been studying the philosophy of “Stocism” and says it’s helpful for him. I have also found reading about Stocism helpful for myself. I am struggling with accepting this terrible reality that I am losing my first child. I’m just trying to remember that when we’re born, no one ever knows when they are going to die or how they will die. The only thing that is certain about life is that everyone does die. We are just pretending that everyone gets to live a long life because most of us live in too much denial to face the reality that it can happen any time and any day. We need to work harder on that in our culture. We have too much denial about a lot of issues. My heart goes out to you. I’m so sorry. You are so young. Life feels so unfair sometimes."
Badabing-_badabooms,"I’ll definitely look into all of that. It’s definitely hard to think that everyone dies at some point. It’s natural and something we all have in common. We live every single day, yet only die once— (if we’re lucky) I’ll definitely look into your suggestions, and I’m sorry about your son. Good luck to you both."
DerkSC,Sorry to hear about your condition. Get strenght from family and friends. I’ll say a prayer for you.
charlie1701,"OP, I'm sorry to hear you and your fiancé are in this situation. I started dating my partner just after his terminal diagnosis. He had a good quality of life for much longer than expected but passed away in June. We made a lot of happy memories together and got really good at communicating. I started therapy a year into his treatment and highly recommend it. I needed somewhere to dump my feelings so I could be there for him. Even though he was terminal, nothing went as expected. We made plans, travelled and enjoyed our extra time together as long as we were able. Having lots of photos, voice messages, videos and our cat helps me now. It is tough, no question. But he was totally worth it and I wouldn't change anything. We had fun and laughed a lot even in the final months."
RumbleMotionJawbone,"Sorry you’re here. I was told at 35 that I had stage 4, incurable cancer. I had just moved to a new place that I loved, had recently taken a big step forward in my career and was finally feeling ready to get myself out there and date after a difficult break up. Needless to say, I fell apart a bit. Therapy helped a lot. I focused on doing things I liked when I felt up to it physically. I spent time on hobbies and picked up some new ones. I spent a lot of time with friends and family. Just be nice to yourself. When you feel sad, let yourself feel sad. Time makes things easier. If you’re open to it and able to access them, psilocybin mushrooms helped me truly get to the acceptance stage of the process. Otherwise, just enjoy every sandwich. I wish I had more to offer than these borrowed bits of wisdom, but they’re what helped me along the way. Godspeed, friend."
redditrunaway,"Live every moment as if it were your last, make the most beautiful days and relaxing nights not only for yourself, but for your family. Be resilient and keep fighting. Keep reaching out. Never stop fighting this battle. I and many others are here for you. No matter what. I am so, so fu*king sorry you’re dealing with this. I all to well know the pain. Everyday we wake up and fight the cancer. Stay proactive everyday, even on the bad ones. Sending this with love. dd"
Cat-perns-2935,"I just got diagnosed myself with stage 4 breast cancer that has spread to my liver, the prognosis is not to good and I’m only 42, I’ve been a stay at home mom since I was 22, always thought I’d start working when my kids 19 and 14 wouldn’t need my as much, That we’d get to travel more, and that I’d do more with my life, I refuse to accept that I only have a few years left, I want to still be here to see my grandchildren be born and grow up, I get hope from one of my husband’s mentors, who was diagnosed with lung cancer at 40, and was told to get ready to die, the cancer had spread everywhere and he only had a month to live, He went home and cried, and raged and then accepted God’s will and prayed, I don’t know if you’re religious at all but I hope it helps you as it helps me, I met him in his late seventies and he died at 82, Start your treatment but support your body through it as the cure is almost as bad as the disease, but please stay hopeful, The treatment might make it that you might not be able to have kids, but doctors don’t really have all the answers, and when they give a number, I don’t really think it means anything, a lot of people outlive their prognosis, Stay hopeful"

PsychoMouse,"For me, it was easier than it would be for most. I was born with Cystic Fibrous. I’ve spent my entire life being told I’ll die, nonstop. I was on the double lung transplant list, thinking I was going to die. I got the phone but my head was still thinking I’m going to die. Then every year they’re back to tell me I’m going to die. I ended up getting a side effect from my anti rejection meds(and people bitch about vaccine side effects) Post transplant high grade, B-cell, non-Hodgkins, stage 4 lymphoma with a less than 5% chance at surviving. Was called into my cancer care doctors office. My wife just zoned and blocked that memory. She literally can’t remember it. I deal with it like I deal with most things, a random mix of the 5 steps to recovery."

StrangeJournalist7,"At this point, worry less about protein, etc., and more about just getting calories. Ensure or something like that could help. I ate yogurt, applesauce, eggs, cereal. Avocado toast was good, also toast with peanut butter. The hospital food was disgusting, I will agree with that! A warning: if you are only at +4, you are likely to feel worse before you feel better. (I went through this 18 months ago.) Did you get melphalan before?"
StrangeJournalist7,"Maybe ice cream or a milkshake, too."
INTPLibrarian,Ensure with ice cream to make a shake.
jenzebel728,"My daughter straight up refused all solid foods because they all tasted horrible to her after her stem cell transplant. We started giving her fortified milk (think ensure) and spiked it with duocal, it's a powder that adds calories. The doctors said the most important thing at that point was calories and they didn't care how she got it. This kept her at a consistent weight. Oh, milkshake with it worked alright as well (I was purposely getting peanut butter ones for the extra). So if there's a liquid you can stomach, try getting some of that or something similar to just get something in you."
chellychelle711,"First congrats on your transplant! You have a bumpy 2-3 weeks ahead of you so right now, eat as much as you can because you won’t want anything during engraftment. High protein, high calorie is the goal of each meal and you will be on the neutropenic diet until day 100 or when your team gives you the ok. This is just one part of the journey where you don’t make the rules so it’s really just looking at it as temporary. Mind over matter. Your body needs a lot of fuel to get you through to the other side. It’s got to completely rebuild your body. Feed it, help it do its job. The diet is no fun and your taste will be off for quite awhile so eating for enjoyment will have to come later. Use plastic utensils. Add peanut butter to everything especially. Grilled cheese sandwiches. Beef stew or other stews full of lentils and beans. Shakes either premade or made with a protein powder added to it. Stay away from spicy and acidic foods fo the time being. Your mouth and GI will thank you. Mac & cheese since you can do noodles. Whatever it is, add protein to the meal. And you don’t have to have 3 meals a day. Break them down into smaller snack size meals and time them with meds or before you walk. Get a schedule together so your fueling throughout the day. This is the part that sucks but it’s what you get through to the rest of your life. Best wishes"
JulieMeryl09,"Hi. Not sure if hospital has pizza. Once I was home I only add pizza, uncut (cutter germs) and sliced it myself. Can they bring u some Ensures. U need to eat. Best wishes."
No_Cap_9561,Cutter germs?
Laura295,Pizza is a really good idea I will definitely ask if I can order food or my parents could bring me take out.
misochicken,I did a lot of takeout during the month immediately after my transplant. Helped with the calories and the variety meant food was still semi-exciting even though nothing ever tasted good until my taste buds got back to normal.
drevoluti0n,"Melphalan hasn't kicked in, yet. Thoughts and prayers. They should have a dietician or nutritionist on staff that could help make sure you're getting the calories you need. Mine had me drink 2 chocolate calorie boosted Ensures per meal. I drank them through a straw with a LOT of ice, and it was tolerable."
cancerkidette,I ate a load of instant ramen! It’s a good hospital snack because you just need hot water and it’s calorie dense. I ate a lot of cheese (like fondue type stuff) and milkshakes because they’re easy to get down- i also second the pizza suggestion. Soup is easy to get down and can be made more calorie dense by adding powdered milk. I’d also speak to your dietician in hospital to help support your nutrition and get food you like better. Day four is very early on so I’d hang in there. Be prepared for methotrexate mouth sores. Sometimes you can access a “special or cultural menu”- as I was vegetarian I had extra options from the Asian and Caribbean menu at my hospital in the UK which are more spiced and seasoned. I also liked the cancer cookbook by Rebecca Katz. She’s a chef whose father had cancer and she adapted lots of recipes to be extra nutritious and palatable to patients. Some are free online too. I especially liked the mineral broth.
Laura295,"Instant ramen is so simple why didn't I think of it. That's a really good idea. I love soups in general. Sadly we only have the option for vegi, easily digestible and normal meals. And they are all just the same with some changes. I will definitely meet with the dietician tomorrow and ask for some changes and if they are possible. I didn't get methotrexate ""only"" fluderabin, treosulfan and thiotepa. They said I will get mouth sores but it still looks good and I got a special mouthwash and a oral care plan I have to follow. So I hope I don't really get them or at least mild."

Started as a breast cancer, moved to my liver , then brain and uterus extending to colon and rectum. Then bile duct and stomach . Honestly, it’s been a roller coaster but getting to be here for my husband and son, spending more time with my beautiful sisters and mom and all my amazing friends has been totally worth the constant chemo, MRIs , CTs and blood draws."

After 9 months after the transplant i felt normal again, now i enjoy every day, going on vacation a lot and spent as much time with my family as i can (before cancer it worked 50 jours a week) I am 4 years clean now."

""party on!"" i hope you soon will have your own success story to tell to future survivors, happy healing!"

Had consultation radiation a couple of months later and been officially in remission for a year since 11th of August. I’m healthy, I’m strong, and so much better."
Valuable_Process_299,Stage 4 lung for over a year. Still kicking
Faunas-bestie,"From what I’ve learned, there’s a difference between a “survivor” and what some call themselves, a “thriver”. Survivors seem to go from a stage 4 diagnosis to either remission or NED and enjoy that status (or worry about recurrence) for years and years. Maybe it goes away for good and they can never really believe their good fortune. The self-described “thrivers” are those who go through maintenance chemo or “chemo for life” and cycle on and off treatment. This is my situation it would seem. My prognosis is four years, give or take, but I hope to last longer to watch my grandchildren grow up a bit. A cure is not currently an option, but shrinkage of lung Mets or stability of the same, is the hope."

That was 9 years ago.He is doing great.Has so much energy.He retired 11 years ago,but still does consulting work and has been working 50 plus hours a week for the last 5 months.Not to sound arrogant but we don’t need the money,, it’s just that he truly loves what he’s doing.Also he doesn’t do any special diets.The first year was horrible, but slowly but surely he got through it and has been cancer free ever since. I hope this helps.The diagnosis of stage 4 cancer is devastating BUT it’s not necessarily a death sentence. In fact there are a lot of success stories out there.The journey is hard but sometimes can be won.I hope this helps."
smartypants333,"I was diagnosed stage 1 in 2021 (age 43), had surgery (to remove the lower right lobe of my lung) and was told I was cancer free. It recurred 18 months later (2022), stage 4, now in my bones and the pleural lining. I am going to say, that for me, I'm experiencing the absolute blessing that is modern medicine. I hesitate to say blessing because I'm not religious. My cancer has a genetic mutation that can be blocked with a targeted treatment. A single pill I take every day that has minimal side effects. I haven't had any chemo or radiation. I have CT scans every 3 months, and as of my last scans, I have no progression. The drug works on average 3-10 years until you become resistant. The hope being that they come up with something even better before that happens (maybe the cancer vaccine?) Anyway, I will likely live with stage 4 cancer for rest of my life, but that could be a LONG time."

It wasn’t looking good but I went forward with aggressive chemo and 6 months, 5 rounds and 1 total hysterectomy/bilateral oopherectomy and tumor debulking I am cancer-free. Last two rounds are for good measure and I’ll do immunotherapy every six weeks probably forever due to a gene defect but I am hopeful. I’ve come a long way since my diagnosis. I wish you the best!"

JHutchinson1324,"Hello, I was diagnosed with stage IV anaplastic large cell lymphoma at the end of 2019. I was given the best prognosis of 50/50 to make it 2 years with treatment. I went through treatment, I had a stem cell transplant, and now I am still here four plus years after my transplant and almost five years since my diagnosis at the end of this year. I have a very long post from 2019 with all of the details of what happened and how and when if you want to read through that, it's very long though so I'll just kind of hit some of the highlights here. For ten months I had an unexplained itch all over my body and I was having excruciating back pains. My doctor continuously told me that I was being dramatic, or imagining things, or that my house was dirty, or that my dogs were dirty, or just anything for him to not have to do any actual work for me. I woke up one morning completely paralyzed from the waist down so I checked myself into the emergency room and luckily they found all of the tumors on my spine and in my hip. I had four broken vertebrae and my left hip was broken all from tumors growing in those bones. I was told at this time that if I hadn't checked myself into the ER or if we hadn't actually caught the cancer I probably would have been dead in two weeks or so from the tumors completely strangling my nervous system and shutting down my body. I had ten rounds of targeted radiation on all five of my tumors and luckily they shrank to almost nothing. At that point I got a little bit of feeling back from the waist down but it's pins and needles neuropathy, even today this is permanent, so it feels like when you sit on the toilet for too long and your legs go numb. I will say it's not as bad in my waist area as it is in my feet, I feel slight numbness around my hips but then the numbness and the pins and needles exponentially increases as it goes down my body so that my feet are not completely numb but at that point to where they are super sensitive from the pins and needles. Even when my dog accidentally steps on my foot it almost sends me through the roof cuz it hurts so bad. I was in a wheelchair from all of this but because I need to walk to take care of myself because my caregiver is not actually useful or reliable, I taught myself how to walk again. I currently walk with a cane but I did walk with a rollator there for a little while in the middle and it helped a lot with my balance. After radiation I had six rounds of R-CHOP chemotherapy. it went pretty well and at the halfway mark we did a scan and everything seemed to be working so we continued with the other cycles. I was told that at that scan if the treatments were not working we would not have continued on that route and I guess something else would have been done. Now, I don't know, it's possible that they would have just told me that there was nothing they could do but I didn't ask what the alternative would have been because I didn't want to really think about that at that point. I finished my chemotherapy in March of 2020. I was told from almost the beginning that they would want to give me a stem cell transplant if my chemotherapy worked and I was able to get into remission. This wasn't mentioned until quite a ways into my treatment because I think they were waiting to see if it was even a possibility for me to get into remission. From what I understand that was one of the requirements of the stem cell transplant was being NED. So I was supposed to get my stem cell transplant in June I think or may of 2020 but it was during the height of covid and I was really afraid so I did push it back a little bit, it also helps that I was having a very hard time recovering from chemotherapy so they also thought that it might have benefited me to have a little bit of extra time in between. We started all of the prep for the transplant in June and I checked myself into the hospital for the actual procedure July 10th of 2020, one day before my 34th birthday. I had an auto transplant so I feel like I was lucky in that I didn't have to deal with a lot of the other issues that come with transplants like gvhd. I was in the hospital I think 24 or 25 days and then once my immune system rebounded enough for them to release me I was sent home. Typically I would have stayed around the hospital, I had my transplant about 2 hours from my home, but because this was covid and they didn't want me staying in a hotel they sent me all the way home and just discharged me to my regular oncologist. I'm pretty sure that normally at this point you get a lot of support but because of covid I had absolutely no support, and I was just told to follow up with my regular oncologist which I've done but I'm not sure what I missed out on here and what might actually occur for somebody getting a transplant outside of a pandemic. I think for the first year I had scans every 3 months and then we went to every 6 months and after year 3 I haven't had a scan and I expect to have one at my 5th year mark next summer. I've been told that even though my lymphoma is technically uncurable that if I am able to stay in remission for 5 years I will be considered medically cured. And holy hell I said I was going to hit the highlights, and this is still ridiculously long I'm so sorry. It's just you know there's a lot involved. If you have any specific questions I can definitely answer or if you want me to expand on anything I can do that too, I just don't want to make this a 1,000 page novel lol"

Limp_Falcon_2314,"Yep. Diagnosed mNSCLC in June, 2023. The tumors in my lung had metastasized to the bone (hip and spine) and brain. The biggest tumor in my lung was close to cutting off my lung from my ability to use it and as a result I had severe pneumonia too, with my lung nearly 50% full of fluid. I had to do emergency brain surgery and then shortly after do another brain surgery to install a shunt. A few weeks after I had healed from that I got whole brain radiation and radiation on my hip bone. Then they discovered a mutation in my cancer (ALK+) that allowed me to be put on a drug called Alecensa. June this year I was declared NED. My prognosis changed so much. They thought I wouldn’t make it two days at first and called in my family to get on flights immediately. Then they said 6 weeks - it changed over and over again. Here I am a year later with no evidence of disease."

seacucumberrr,"My mate has stage 4 breast cancer, it has spread in her lungs and discs. She got diagnosed in 2017-2018 but she didn’t want to go the conventional way (she has a PHD so would be used to do her own research and dig into what’s out there). She went full keto and carnivor, continued to practice Brazilian jiu jitsu the whole time, did do some chemo and radiotherapy but didn’t find anything convincing and it was later confirmed by her doctors that they can be good short term but that they basically create an environment for the cancer to grow back in the long term. Fast forward to last year the cancer came back and is now stage 4, she once again won’t go the conventional way and found this treatment called DON. It’s at a very experimental stage and is taking this up on her own. She has to eat in a very specific way and go into hbot chambers when taking the DON doses so it kills the cancer properly. This is from my basic understanding of the situation. I just admire her for owning her own health, questioning the methods around cancer and not taking the words of doctors for granted. She is doing her own research, taking her health into her own hands and some of her doctors around her are working with her and doing what they can to support her. We will see where it takes her but I just find her to be such a great example. Also she doesn’t have any cancer symptoms at all, just tired more quickly when she’s training. She’s incredible."
natgastek67,"Daughter is stage 4, friend just passed after having stage 4, Mom and brother both had cancer. It's all around me.. i try and live an anti cancer life through the protocols of Dr. Thomas Seyfried and Dr. Valter Longo. It seems like we all have it at a small level until we get the diagnosis at a much higher level like my daughter. Our body fights it until it can setup and find sources to feed itself and grow. I've read that one it gets to a certain level and we are fighting it with chemo/radiation then it becomes much harder to get rid of and the tumor cells can mutate and come back faster. There is so much involved with this disease and if you have gone through this with family friends and personally you know this. But these doctors talking about it as a metabolic disease instead of genetic as most oncologists still believe have given me allot of Hope. I have many friends in remission or NED.. or whatever you want to call it. But i always remind them that it can come back fast and hard! I've seen it. Just do your research people and read and watch as much as possible."

KnurledNut,I use THC gummies. Works on my nausea as good as the meds do.
topfarms,Same. They help me with nausea and anxiety
Better-Class2282,"I wouldn’t recommend smoking because it can cause a potential infection, stick to gummies."
cancerkidette,"Does she have a robust anti nausea regimen? Is she taking her current meds round the clock at exact intervals? Does she have multiple types of anti nausea meds working at once? Have you checked to see if she may have bad acidity because of chemo, as this can cause horrible nausea too? If the answer to any of these is NO then she needs to sort that out first with her medical team. Weed is fine but it’s not some kind of magic drug that necessarily works any better than conventional medicines for nausea."
Couture911,In my experience THC worked much better than the other antiemetics I have been prescribed. Most antiemetics will keep me from throwing up and will reduce the nausea to some extent. THC does more than stop the nausea. It also makes me feel hungry and makes eating more pleasurable. Its ability to stimulate appetite helped so much when I was dropping weight quickly.
cmeremoonpi,"Thc/cbd/delta 8 works wonders. Pain, anxiety and nausea. I recommend an indica strain. Gummies or tincture under the tongue. It takes a good 45 minutes to kick in. Start with a small dose, 5 MG at the most. I also use topical balms and salves for muscle pain."
TampaBob57,"Seconded on the Indica strain, I started at 2.5mgs which was easy to do with chocolate squares and it sometimes takes 1.5 hours or longer. Try a small dose one day and then try again the next day.The mantra is to go low and slow. Start with a low dose and slowly increase it to dial it in.Indica is more relaxing while sativa is more trippy.I also have pure cbd oil on hand just incase I need to counteract the effects, that and black peppercorns to chew on and cold showers are supposed to be the best."

I’m talking I have to walk around with a spit cup all day and gag really bad and occasionally am throwing up because of chemo, I only survived half the time because of zofran. My body built a tolerance for the zofran so I went the gummy route. That definitely helped me but now I smoke pre rolls from the dispensary and in general the weed is a HUGE help. Nausea wise and muscle relaxation wise. I swear by its effectiveness. Out of all the drugs they’ve given me weed and a zofran was my best way of fighting the extreme nausea."
lumpytorta,I was using edibles to help with the appetite and nausea but if she can’t hold anything down or hasn’t been able to eat it’s time to go to er or contact the oncologist
Bowler-Melodic,I was gonna say same as most. Gummies/edibles there’s cbd thc mix ones than don’t get u high but help and then the all thc but she will be high some but it helps
NoLab2107,"I had non hodgkin stage 4 the worst side effects were nausia and problems with eating, i live in Belgium next to the border in Holland, so Weed was easy to get, i did help a lot with my nausia, and my eating problem, food tasted better, it also helpt with my sleep problem, so for me it was very benificial, you dont have to smoke like 3 or 4 joint, a few puffs now and then can surely help. Hope this helps"
reditrewrite,"It’s the ONLY thing that helped me. Highly recommend. That being said if she’s finished her last round and made it this far without it, things will get better quickly ans she may not need it."
theantiantihero,"Indica gummies have helped me with nausea, loss of appetite and pain relief. However, I’d also highly recommend an antiemetic medication called Emend. After getting very sick after my first two chemo infusions, my oncology nurses started giving that to me in my IV along with my Taxol and the nausea went away completely. It was (maybe literally) a lifesaver for me. Whatever your mom tries, I hope she gets some relief."
Aware-Marketing9946,"I found a few things that help: Sipping on ginger ale, and ginger chews. Green tea and chamomile helped a bit. She needs to stay hydrated... that will help. Small meals/bites of food. This will pass! Prayers to you and yours 🙏"
jw071,"I was on compazine, zofran, and a $100/day sancuso patch and only when I started getting care packages from potheads was I able to eat. I was raised Southern Baptist myself, so I mean tell mom that Genesis plainly states that the “herb yeilding seed and the tree bearing fruit” here intended to be used. There’s also the fact that the calamus used in the holy oil does not grow in the land of Canna, but canna-bis does (the italicized words are the translator’s best guess in the KJV). If she hasn’t decided you’re a complete heathern yet there’s the old “God made weed, man made speed; who do you trust?” you can try."
Terrible-Big-Baby888,I take CBD/THC infused gummies before bed to help with nausea/sleep/appetite. I do also smoke but I’d stick with the gummies for mom. Remind her.. none of this is ideal but we want her better and part of that is getting through chemo & being able to eat. I will be hoping for the best for her 💗
OnlyTheGoodDieYun,It’s been critical for me. I’m responding well to treatment and my oncologist is on board very much even in a non legal state.
Nyc12331,"I do! It works wonders and more often than not the only thing that helps. Highly recommend, just make sure it’s a strain you can tolerate."
No-Orange-7618,Best to get a prescription instead. Chemo nausea is brutal.
labboy70,"I had a great deal of nausea during radiation. Low dose THC was much more effective for me than Zofran. Zofran would address the nausea but I still had no desire to be around or smell food. THC got rid of the nausea and made me able to consider eating food. I had an aunt with esophageal cancer who we were able to get to use THC. She was so reluctant at first but we got her going on smaller doses at first and she realized how much it helped her nausea but also sleep and overall relaxation. What we did with her is to take some along with her at first to make her more comfortable. I also found that when I was really nauseated, I could take 5-10 mg of a gummy and the nausea would resolve but I wouldn’t really feel “stoned”. I could take that same amount when I had no nausea and felt generally good and would get a pleasant buzz. I even tried using the same product / package to rule out it was a product related issue. It was interesting because I’ve heard the same thing from others using it for nausea or pain."
richterj81,"Big porthead here. I stopped completely at first during treatment. Shortly in, I figured out a pure CBD regimen helped my gut tolerance tremendously. I was scared of the real shit for a minute. Hit CBD regularly, and it did more for my nausea and food tolerance than any scripted meds. Your mileage may vary. Much love."
Laffingglassop,It helps a ton two times bone sarcoma survivor two times chemo my god send em to me and I’ll be the hard evidence
DAPatient,"Yes. I have a prescription (as per my state laws) for medical MJ. I take a tincture (drops under the tongue) that has equal CBD & THC. It's not very strong, so I don't get any high from it but it does knock the nausea within a few minutes (and lasts a couple of hours)."
DAPatient,"BTW, the different forms take different amounts of time to kick in. In general, smoking will be the fastest (and last the shortest amount of time), then a tincture, then edibles. I use my prescription as a backup to my layered anti-nausea drugs, so I wanted something fast acting (but I haaaaate the smell of weed so smoking was a nonstarter, hence the tincture)."
EmpathyWillSaveUs,If she can’t eat then smoking will help 100%. Smoking isn’t the best method since smoking in general is bad but if you can’t eat then it is what it is. Tinctures would also be good if she can’t eat.
This-Army6223,Delta 8 gummies helped me with nausea and allergies but I'm ultra sensitive and I didn't like how they made me feel. I couldn't even tolerate a half in without being buzzy. Can she layer compazine and zofran together?
EnvironmentalFox952,It has been working for me I have mantel cell cancer and bone cancer I was diagnosed last year and have been in chemo and had a stem cell transplant and I was given a medical marijuana card for nausea and anxiety and it has been a lot better since I was having trouble eating it helped with that of course I sleep through the night now I am not saying it is for everyone but is worth looking into
justlookingthere,I’m always high. I smoke pre rolls from the dispensary or take an edible. It helps immensely with appetite and nausea

lord_ive,"You have to keep moving forward. There’s no point in denying yourself things you want to do just because you had, or have cancer. Don’t limit your life - if you survive, it will be much better to have continued forward. There are limits to this, of course. In my case, I switched careers entirely and am doing something which makes me much more fulfilled."
bismaiqbal22,"For me, trying to get back to what my life used to be had been pretty up and down. Hell, I found going through chemotherapy easier aha! Only because I knew I was sick and didn’t even bother worrying about my appearance. But now that I’m done and am in recovery mode, I kind of wish things would speed up, you know? So I can look myself again. Wear makeup, take pictures, go out without having people immediately recognize it’s a wig. I went from accepting a job offer out west to getting diagnosed the same day and since then, my life goals changed completely. And I know it might’ve been for their better but it still sucks. Seeing people I went to school with getting job promotions, traveling at ease, getting married etc. I admit I get jealous. Because my life’s on a completely different level now, my perspective went from enjoying life to hoping my scans come out clear. This experience took a toll on me for sure, but I guess the best I can do is take it day by day and give myself the time to heal. It’s good to think positive and be confident that everything will be okay, but I learned it’s also okay to mourn what I had and cry once in a while. And so far, I feel more at peace with myself and my life. I’m working and interviewing for jobs, can’t travel yet but go out with friends and family without feeling nervous, dating I personally want to wait on till I’m ready and just trying to enjoy the little things, which was something I never did before my diagnosis."
3DNZ,"I was 18 when diagnosed/treated Took a year after my last treatment to start working and going to college. By 24, unexpectedly, my daughter was born. By 27 I landed my dream job At 35 I moved to another country to work at my dream company At 42 I received my Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Blackbelt At 43 I was able to by my 1st house. Currently at 46 I'm a supervisor at my.dream job/company and have my own Brazilian Jiu Jitsu school. I've done heaps of travelling and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Honestly I don't think any of this would be possible if I didn't experience cancer and surviving. It motivated me and made me thankful for every second I have being alive."
Heatseeker81514,"I was diagnosed with stage 1 triple negative breast cancer at 32 snd stage 4 at 34. My lung nodules were found about 2.5 months after finishing a year of treatments and stage 4 diagnosis 2 months after. I have started a new treatment. I never really got to adjust back to normal because my reoccurance came quickly. I don't have many goals career wise anymore, but I would still like to start a family. My perspective has changed. I used to get stressed just thinking about managing a home and a family in the future, but now that seems like such a privileged problem to have. I guess it's made me more appreciative of the little things."
birdnerd0105,"I’m 23 and still going through treatment, but there are a few things that I have learned going through it that I will certainly be taking with me navigating life after it. At first, dating sounded really scary, but the one thing multiple people have truly engrained in me is that a current diagnosis or a past diagnosis is no reason to hold you back from getting out there. When you do bring it up, it is so important to remember that any reaction you might get is no reflection on you. As a funny example, recently my pants fell down in the middle of the road with people around because a wasp was attacking me and I swatted a little bit too aggressively and forgot to put on my belt that day. One lady scolded me for being indecent, but other people giggled because it was funny. My point is, my pants falling down happened and being both scolded and giggled at by different individuals is no reflection on me! If you think cancer is a definite dealbreaker, it’s NOT. So don’t let that get in your way!!! Just remember to stay true to yourself and know that dating does not change just because of cancer. I’m still in university so I can’t speak professionally, but as for school, I appreciate the opportunities to learn and grow in a way that I didn’t entirely grasp before. My time off has allowed me to explore the kind of things I really enjoy in life which has put me on a completely new path. I wish I never had cancer, but in a way I’m thankful that I’m so young because now I know what I want to do for the rest of my life. I’m using it as a tool to help build a professional career I love in the future. Perspective on life for me has also changed. I realized that a lot of things I stressed over before are out of my control and at the end of the day, don’t really matter. Cancer is out of my control and I can’t do anything but get the treatment. For example, I have always had long hair and was heartbroken when it fell out, but that was out of my control so I got some sweet toques I feel good in because that’s in my control. I focus on what is in my control to live more stress-free. After getting this in my head, my mental state has certainly changed for the better. My idea of being successful changed too. To me, success is now building a life I am truly happy with and always remembering to be there in the moment. One more thing I learned is that it is extremely important to be in touch with your feelings and accepting you’re going to have good days and bad days in life cancer or not, and that you shouldn’t be afraid to be in touch with those feelings. I try my best to keep a positive attitude, but other days I am the biggest grouch in town who cries at dropping a fork on the ground because I am sad about what’s going on. And I realize it is okay to feel that way! And that realization and acceptance is key. My best friend from the cancer clinic told me that the only way out of cancer is through, and while the journey through can feel so discouraging and challenging, you need to cut yourself a break and be proud of yourself. To me, for anyone navigating life after cancer, some things might include focusing on yourself, your goals, your needs, what makes you happy, and living in the moment. And most importantly, to be proud of yourself and never settle because life is simply too short to not feel fulfilled."
adultingwhilelost,"Stage 3c BC when I was 27 and stage 4 at 35. With MBC it’s forever treatment but low intensity - this is the same amount of treatment as I had when I was in remission for stage 3. I had a good chunk of time to do bucket list things and establish my career between. Now I’m trying to figure out what to do with my remaining time too haha. What I would say is that life goes fast. I took the time to travel the world, live in different countries and make a name for myself professionally. But when I got to the point where I can slow down professionally to focus on the personal I got diagnosed with MBC… Being established professionally is a load off the mind when dealing with MBC because I’m now in a position to slow down without it affecting my career trajectory and tbh even before the diagnosis I knew I didn’t want to climb any further. But I am established enough that I can push back the start of a new job for radiotherapy and be accommodated. The personal side is harder because well, where is the dating pool for management level professionals with MBC in their mid 30s? There’s also the ethical dilemma of how I can promise someone romantically “forever” when my expected expiration date is a lot sooner than my partner’s? I would say concentrate on one thing at a time - time is limited for people like us and trying to be all things to all people at all time will mean you end up with nothing. Life is short and we’ve all spent a lot of time others didn’t have to in treatment. Don’t wait for other people to do what you want to - just go for it."

Caseyleehs,"31 and was diagnosed this year. I’m already married so no dating help here. But my job made me redundant so that’s fun. I haven’t been able to go back to work yet. I have an upcoming surgery so who’s going to bother hiring me now 🙄 I find it did actually slightly help my depression. But aside from that, I didn’t really change much. I do hope to have cards and letters done for my kids just in case. That’s probably the only goal besides surviving that I have right now."
alviejetportlit9367,"Yeeeeah 29 here - was in a really good space in life before diagnosis, incredible career, travelling the world, had a partner, was rapidly becoming more comfortable in myself and who I was, unravelling some previous personal traumas and doing all the things I loved. Felt invincible. Was diagnosed in March and felt like my whole world stopped. Went through treatment with the mindset of just doing what I needed to day by day to give myself the best chance of beating it. Became increasingly depressed and completely numb to the world during. I couldn’t work, travel, see friends, I lost my partner, my body changed, I lost my hair, felt too weak to do much at all. Thankfully I got NED in June. Had final surgery around then as well and am in monitoring now. Im absolutely infinitely grateful to be in this spot, but honestly - I don’t think I’ll be back to the person I was, the utter trauma this experience has caused has genuinely fucked me up and is indescribable to anyone who hasn’t been through it. I still read my bloodwork notes and stand there in disbelief that the damn thing says ‘malignant tumor’. I was seeing a therapist for a while, but i felt like it wasn’t helping. For now, im just focusing on the good things in life, and trying not to dwell on the future too much - it’s easy to worry sick about recurrence. I’ve built back enough strength to get out and do things, I’ve found more value in working out than I ever have before - it’s been so helpful mentally. Back into a work routine, but completely out of dating for now as I’ve taken a huge step backward in being comfortable in myself which sucks. But all in all, just continuing to take it day by day because nothing is guaranteed in life. Survivorship is definitely tougher than I expected."
kazthelad,"I keep going back and forth between ""who knows how long I have, let's live lavishly"" and ""let's be healthy and secure in case I live longer than prognosis"". It's not super healthy but I just try to settle somewhere between the two and take and appreciate each day."
Proseccos,"I was diagnosed about a decade ago, but I do fit in the age range now. I am not one of those strong positive people that kicked cancer in the ass. I’ve long outlived my prognosis, through sheer luck alone, not at all through my efforts. I hid the diagnosis from everyone except my husband, who passed not long after. My friends found out eventually. Work never did. I was a full time STEM pre-med in college, starting a new full time job, and trying to deal with chemo all at once. It left me with near nil hours to sleep. I always prioritized school and work, and never finished a full course of chemo. I always gave up. I was very much a type-A gunner in school. Top of the class, good at almost everything on the first try (except baseball), athlete, a million hobbies, work hard to the bone, you can do anything you want-you make your dreams come true, Asian parents wet dream. I loved who I was, and I loved my life, because I started off in a completely different place and built it all from there. Cancer broke that lol. To this day, I haven’t come to terms with the fact that my brain is still writing checks that my body can’t cash. Chemo made me stupid. I am extraordinary no longer. I am no longer the best. I am no longer good at almost anything at the first try. I’ve lost my confidence to be honest. I now believe, there is quite a lot that I cannot do, not at least in the way I could before, and that brings a sense of melancholy. Before, failure was never failure. It was…exploration. It was that something required tweaking. Now failure sometimes hurts my ego and everything makes me self conscious about it being cancer related. It’s like I’ve aged backwards in maturity lol Things worked out okay in the end. I was “successful” still, in society’s terms. I retired early. But I do miss who I used to be. I think I would consider myself successful if I can build myself to the person I’d like to be. I think it’s unrealistic now to be extraordinary. I can’t bring my brain back. But I need to adjust now, to a more realistic new norm. And if I can achieve whatever I set, I think they’ll be contentment there. Externally, it’s all doable. In general, people don’t care in the dating life about the cancer in my experience. At work I always hid it, I had to adjust because it was competitive environment. But internally, a level of self awareness and acceptance is required. I was in denial, constantly waiting for things to pass and to get my brain and body back. And reality is, it’s not happening, for me. Learning to accept this lower standard, as grim as it sounds, has given me some peace."
Healingph,"It’s difficult. When you are just starting your dreams and building your own career, all just shatter. Only to find your way in the unknown. Unknown of the future and everything that will happen"
mykeawesome,"I was diagnosed with Leukemia (AML) at 35, almost exactly a month before my birthday. At the time I was in a successful career and was leveraging that experience to get a new better paying job. In fact the day I was diagnosed I was supposed to have my final interview with the hiring manager of the new job. My goal at that time was to get enough of a salary that I could let my wife quit her job and go back to school to pursue her own career goals. I also have a young daughter who was 3 at the time and I was contemplating what my career successes could afford her moving forward. Needless to say all of my plans went out the window after diagnosis. But I was quick to get into a bone marrow transplant and that was presented as ""the cure"" for my AML. I went through treatment and the long recovery process that went along with that. While recovering I spent a lot of time thinking about my previous career and realizing that I worked myself so hard that I probably broke down my own body health. I decided that I would focus on making my joy into my career and spent the next two years trying to build my own company. It was tough because the recovery was long but I was enjoying where I was putting my efforts in both my own work and having the opportunity to be home with my daughter. That whole time I was on disability but since I was in remission my time was running out to be on disability so I had to consider getting back into a job or pull the trigger on trying to make money from the company I was still working on. Well neither of those realities mattered because at 38 I was diagnosed with a relapse. I'm currently going through treatment and once again all plans have been thrown out the window. I still have to goal to launch my company and put my focus into that but the reality right now is that I'm struggling day to day just to be able to get up and make myself lunch. So my goals and ambitions have become more short sighted in that I'm just trying to be the best I can be day to day. My daughter is 6 now and I just try to pool my strength enough to be a good dad for her when she gets home from school. And my wife is still in the same job she had that I wad trying so hard to help her to grow out of. But now she has the only health insurance for the household and I'm dependent on her and her job to get my treatment. Fortunately her job has been very supportive and it's been a good place for her during all of this. But if your wondering how goals can change based on a young diagnosis, all I can say is it's hard to plan too far in the future because it feels like nothing is really stable after. Now I still have goals and ambitions but I no longer invest to heavily in them. My goal is just to be the best version of myself I can be day to day and to be there for my family in the best way I can. And my ambition is still to build my own company, but I accept that is dependent on my day to day health and ability to put in the effort. I no longer have the urge to constantly ""push through"" and instead try to give myself the patience and time to get there when I can."
_josterdam_,"Not quite the age range you mentioned buut close. I’m 24.Got diagnosed in January with breast cancer. Went through chemo and surgery and currently awaiting rads and whatever follows that. I got my diagnosis right after I had landed my dream job and at first I was devastated. I spent the first two months of chemo mourning what could have been. I couldn’t plan for the future anymore and all I could think was “this is my life now” Then I surprisingly started adjusting to the reality of cancer and things got a lot better! Somehow I was able to have goals, plans and dreams for the future again and it was great. I realized that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, even though I wasn’t (and still am not) at the end yet.As of right now Im just waiting to finish active treatment and then I’ll go after my career again. I’m young, and still full of energy and will to see and experience things so why not. My goals haven’t changed at all but I do have a new perspective of life. I don’t know if life after will be like life before but navigating this without expectation has helped me tremendously. I just kind of go with the flow now haha."
LaurenFantastic,"Wall of text incoming: I was diagnosed with cervical cancer a month before my wedding at the age of 31 (2021). Having a wedding and cancer treatment during the height of Covid was ALOT - mentally, emotionally and obviously physically. It completely turned all of my husband and I’s life plans upsidown (ex. Starting a family, looking at homes, etc). I entered menopause at 32. I went to counseling, as did my husband and I can’t stress the importance of it enough. I ended up in the mindset of “so what’s the point now” and knowing that you had the possibility of it resulting in a more grave outcome if not caught. I was the youngest patient in the transfusion suite by far and I dealt a lot with survivor’s guilt. 3 years later and I’m happy to say I’m still on NED status (no evidence of disease) - although my body has definitely take a toll due to the lack of hormones (I’m the heaviest I have ever been and getting the weight off feels near impossible, unless I were able to commit to OMAD and the gym every other day). It gets better. I won’t say that I don’t struggle mentally with where I am now, but that voice of “what if the cancer is back” is a lot more like a whisper, when it does decide to show up (usually around times when I have my biyearly exams or if something health related seems out of the norm). I changed my outlook of feeling guilty about taking personal time from work or doing things for me or that I want to do. The mindset of “You only get one chance at life” is more of the constant influence behind my everyday decisions."
LostInYesterday00,"I got diagnosed with thyroid cancer at 24. I knew i had to keep living so after treatment, I did that. I didn’t let it limit me, it was just a setback."
JenovaCelestia,"I was 26 when I was diagnosed. I’m 33 now. When I was diagnosed, I had gotten 6 months prior. I was working as a full-time supervisor in a grocery store and was gunning to make assistant manager. Not super lofty goals, but I was content with the company I worked for and was wanting to move up. Then I get diagnosed, fight cancer, then come back to work. During my treatments, I had to use a walker to walk around. At that point, my mobility was getting better and better and I was using a cane. Eventually I was able to walk unassisted… until about July. The prevailing theory right now is the chemo and/or rads weakened my legs. I had to go through intense physio to bring the strength back and even then, my legs haven’t been the same since. I faced a lot of ableism at work. The final straw was in December 2020. I had called in sick due to my legs and the idiot HR rep we had demanded a COVID test, despite me explaining that I don’t have respiratory symptoms and my symptoms are exactly as indicated in the multitude of doctor’s notes I brought in. The HR rep said word-for-word “you’re cured so you’re fine now”. I should have sued, but I made the decision to go back to school and get a better job. I’d go back to school January 2022, quit that job February 2022, and I’d graduate April 2023. What did I go back to school for? Medical office admin. And I now work at the same outpatient cancer facility that I received treatment. To answer the question, cancer isn’t the end and can be a new beginning. It changes your life and I think the more you fight that and fight to reclaim what is lost, the more it will drag you down."
geowifeRN,Had cancer at 21-22. The year following after I completed treatment I was so lost. Maybe had a PCHP 😘. Met the love of my life and most supportive person ever. Started nursing school at 24 and got married to my spouse the same year. Ended up becoming a nurse to become an Oncology nurse. Still an Oncology nurse over 10 years later.
derekautomatica,"I went back to what I normally did and I’ve been just fine. My goal in treatment was to go back to my normal life and be happy. I still worry about it coming back but I don’t wallow in it. I went back to hanging garage doors, paying my bills, trying to be a good person but most aptly, slowing down. As shitty as this planet may seem, enjoy the simple things."
Nuggies02,"Well 22, little out of range. But they just end up removing my whole rhomboid muscle (MPNST) this was back in February 2024. There were many changed goals and perspective on life, but that could have been growing spiritually. In a relationship now - it’s kinda hard sometimes since they don’t understand none of it - having to get scans every 3 months and seeing the surgical oncologist often - so that can kinda be frustrating (but I honestly just think it’s the man I’m with and just can’t comprehend it). I’m in the process of switching jobs even tho I’ve been here for 4 years since I know it’s not going to get good for my health in the long run (it’s healthcare, it has poor insurance, and horrible staff to patient ratios so just switching someone else). Im thankful for every single day I’m here on this earth breathing since tomorrow is never promised. I was an avid gym goer at pre-cancer - going 5x a week and going into powerlifting and then after surgery not being able to lift more than 10 pounds really sucked. (Now six months later I’m at like 90-95% normal strength back so it’s great to be back in the gym regularly) so I’m so thankful for everyday I get to move my body as well since it truly is a gift"

SnarkySmuggler,"I got diagnosed with breast cancer at 24, I’m 26 now. Once treatment was over I just went back day by day to how my life was. I returned to work, I started going out with my friends more often. I actually stopped dating because I have 0 patience for it and I’ve come to realize I enjoy my own company a lot. My goals in life did change but not just because of cancer. Other things happened during treatment unrelated to cancer that made me decide to change my path in life a little. I’m still figuring things out but that’s just part of being in your 20s tbh"
palemoonlighhtt,"I'm 38, two days bf Xmas of 2023, grew a lump on my neck thought it was a infection. So fastfoward to June been to two doctors,no 1 ever thought it was cancer. Finally go get a Cat scan done... turns out I have metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil that moved to lompnodes. Just got all the hoops in a row and start chemo/radiation on the 10th of this month for 6 weeks... im not good at writing so please bare with me. So my question is this how long after chemo do u start to feel better??? Just in general. How long after did u guys have to wait to get back to work?"
CloverChill,"34 and I was diagnosed this summer. I am currently going back to school for a career change but not letting my diagnosis stop me. Maybe slow me down but after I'm done with treatment I'll likely come back even faster. The only thing that's changed for me myself personally is I've noticed that even though my path seems hopeful now, when I had that 2 week black time (""you have cancer"" and that's ALL you know until you get to your special oncologist) is I swore to myself I wouldn't let fear stop me from anything when making a kind of bucket list. If I want to do it then do it! Now that it's looking up tho I am still sticking to that mindset of nothing should stop me. Life is to short. So one change for the better I guess."
NoLab2107,"I had cancer (Non hodgkin stage 4) when i was 34, i have a wife and a beautiful daughter who was 6 at the time, i had a stemcell transplant because it was a agressieve cancer, beating cancer was the hardest thing i ever did, after my stemcell treatment however it took me about a year to get back to the person i was before the cancer, lots off Ups and downs, also with my wife whose very emotional type. My tip is to take one day at the time, dont look at the future, and try to spent As much time with your family, take care of yourself, eat healty, and keep your mind busy, go for a walk, or on a vacation if you feel better, try Meditation. And keep in contact with your loved ones. My perspectives changed a lot, i was an account Manager who worked 50 hours a week, money back then was very important yo me.. now i work As a Receptionist in a school, the money is shit 😆 but i like it, i have 3 months vacations who i can spent with my family, money a big house a Nice car, doesn't mean nothing to me anymore.. the only thing is the happines of my wife and daughter, if they are happy i am happy."
isaidyothnkubttrgo,"27 when I was diagnosed, relapsed at 28, and got a bone marrow transplant at 28. Worked as best I could through treatments. I can work if I've my laptop do I did. Eventually with my health, family and boyfriend in my hometown ans the job being 2hrs away, I'd to drop one or lose a lot. So I dropped the job. I cried because I was the highest I could go in a place with some good people. Boss got burned by people before trying to work remote (even though I did a great job when we were locked in for covid) so he gave me an ultimatum when I tried to bargin. Relationship wise, I met my boyfriend in 2020. Was just getting back into the swing of being back in the office in 2021 when I got sick. Didn't see him for weeks at a time because of my treatment. Text everyday though and when I was out, he did his best to call round. Sometimes he couldn't because a friend of his has covid or he had a cold and didn't want to pass it onto me. It's been hard. We are only getting around to milestones people make in the first few month together now at 4 years. Travel was suspended because of covid and then my non existent immune system. I've finally planned trips abroad and one to stay with his parents who live in Austria for new years. It's surreal planning ahead in time when i could plan a month ahead before. Now, I'd still like to work in my feild but maybe not the highest role. Its a lot of stress and the buck ends with you. Did a small few weeks as a lower down employee ans it was marvelous to go home and not be contacted afterwards or have stuff to do. I do help out the Cancer society here with my skills so I am keeping them honed. Relationship wise no goals have changed for me. I'm not pushed on getting married or having kids. The radiation and chemo have put me into an early menopause so having kids that are ""mine"" is probably off the table. If I do have the urge to have kids, I'll adopt. No problem to me."
Terminus_terror,"Diagnosed and completed treatment at 32. Actually, I found out a week before my birthday, my son was 8 months old. The after part was hard; rebuilding my life around cancer scans and trying to figure out who I was now, and I had PTSD and a list of new fears. I changed, and it took a few years for me not to feel like a cancer patient on a regular basis. It was freeing to meet people and not feel the urge to tell them everything."
feathernose,"No new perspective on life, sorry. When my cancer got malignant i was 28 and i’m 34 now and finished my 12th chemo (after 3 surgeries and 30 rounds of radiation) a few months ago. Sadly no, it did not gave me a new perspective on life, apart from the fact i need to sign a will, for when the cancer kills me. Dating? That has been very very hard. Maybe because my self esteem is crap after all treatments because my body looks like a 50 year old, but maybe because guys just don’t want to date a woman with cancer. I don’t know. I don’t want to discourage you. Live your life, do what makes your happy, date if you have any libido left, do everything you want. This is the only life you get <3"
Caitiegn,"Only 21, very very different perspective on life. Oddly enough, I don’t feel in a rush to do things now which is the opposite of how I thought I would feel. I feel like I have time to figure out my career and what I want in life. Also, started doing stuff for myself more, stuff that only I want to do."
truiy22,29F - basically it has killed my dreams of having children - I couldn't stand the thought of leaving my children early due to any cancer re-occurrence.
Any-Door-7054,Diagnosed at 27 with stage 4 esophageal. I’m now 29 and living life more then I ever have before. And honestly I feel better than I ever have before aswell. I’ve been going through chemo for two years but I’m about to do some clinicals because I’m over chemo. Just live.
Tootherella,"I got diagnosed with stage 2b ovarian cancer late 2022. I was 26 at the time. I got an open stomach surgery to remove my left ovary + my tumor (which was about the size of a cauliflower) and a couple of BEP chemo cycles. I'm clean now but get regular blood labs and a CT scan every 6 months. Picking up normal life has been difficult. I struggled a lot with my self image due to becoming bald from the chemo. I'm slowly getting back to a length I'm comfortable with so that has helped me feel better. I also wanted everything to be normal again waaay too quickly. Started working my normal hours again like not even 2 months post chemo. It was a big mistake and I couldn't handle it. I took a big step back and decided to take everything more slowly. Baby steps are honestly the best thing you can. Do everything at your own pace and give it all the time you need. Slowly, little by little, you'll start to feel more like yourself again. It's gonna take a lot of patience and it's not gonna be easy, but there's light at the end of the tunnel. I promise! I wish you all the best."
NeitherFox3459,"Everything changed. Some things good, some things bad. There is no script. Stage 4 non Hodgkin’s lymphoma diagnosed at 33, highly athletic. One year and some change into remission and my wife just filed legal separation. It’s a cold world, but there is still a lot of good if you look for it. Keep your head up and keep taking care of yourself. I do therapy weekly and it helps immensely. One thing I still can’t get used to is when people ask, “how are you doing”? It never means what it used to. They always want to know about cancer first and it does get a bit isolating, but they just want to show they care. Everything is definitely different."
girthbrooks1,My sister was 27 when diagnosed… she never got to see 30
PopsiclesForChickens,"I'm 8 months into remission and I still feel this way. Not just fear of a reoccurrence, but also depressed about the permanent side effects from all of the treatment. But people who haven't had cancer don't understand. They think it's like the flu. You got it treated, it's done, you ""beat"" cancer. So you put on a smile for them. I'm actually avoiding a lot of people these days. So I don't have a good answer, except to tell you I know how you feel."
CorporateNonperson,So I'm on therapy right now. I wasn't in therapy during or after treatment. I would recommend it. The entire body/betrayal aspect is pretty loaded. It deserves a bit of exploration.
Limp_Falcon_2314,"I’m not trying to hijack this post but I just wanted to say thank you for your comment, Popsicles. I’m two months out from being declared NED and my family acts like I should pretty much get over having fought cancer for a year because I’m NED. They’re pushing me to do stuff I do not feel ready to do, and tbh being quite mean spirited about it. They essentially think I’m being lazy, even though it has only been two months. My sister and mom trash talk me all the time about moving on and “what I need to be doing.” Thankfully I don’t live with any of them, but it is a constant text and phone call issue amongst the entire family, and also with me. Also, thank you to u/CorporateNonPerson for their comment. That was the first time I’ve ever heard someone else talk about the body betrayal feelings. I feel that very deeply - and was just trying to explain that to my dad the other day. It feels good to know that I’m not alone. I do not worry about reoccurrence as much as I maybe should but I am very depressed about what cancer has done to my body. I’m very sad I’ll never have long hair again and that, as a female, I now look like a balding man. I’m sad about how my balance still hasn’t recovered and my memory issues from whole brain radiation. I’m sad about a lot of the changes to my body."
KitchenLab2536,"Congratulations on completing chemo. This is not insensitive to me at all as a survivor. People who have had cancer, or have someone close who had it, get it. It takes a little time to sink in once treatment is complete. Personally, I then had to deal with anxiety over upcoming CT scans, which is fairly common, from what I’ve heard. Regardless, CONGRATULATIONS!"
Wyde1340,"5 Years stable but on oral targeted therapy forever. , Congratulations on finishing! Hopefully any side effects you had will subside and you can have some joy. One thing that helped me is: IF it comes back, there is no amount of worrying that's going to stop it. Try to enjoy the freedom of no treatment one day at a time."
CorporateNonperson,"As somebody dealing with recurrence right now, enjoy any level of NED you can."
ArmKooky1873,As someone who’s dealing with recurrence and metastasis to lung and bone I am thankful for the 12 years I had good scans and all the days I felt good again and wish I had never let fear steal my joy of living life to the fullest!! And tday when I don’t know what tomorrow holds I find everything from a sunrise to a gentle breeze a beautiful gift I will embrace and enjoy to the fullest!
Upbeat_Simple_2499,"I just finished 9 months of chemo followed by a stem cell transplant. My cancer is incurable. Even if I currently have minimal residual disease, it always comes back. I've had to bite my tongue from reminding people of this when they start gushing over the great news. Makes me feel like a curmudgeon. Then I start thinking about how everyone wants to celebrate with me, but where the fuck were they when I was actually going through it? And then I dismiss my feelings bc who wants to be mad all the time."
windslut,"Ovarian cancer, six cycles of chemo and invasive surgery. Declared to have no evidence of disease, everyone joyful. I felt like I had a guillotine waiting to drop on my neck, never happy with the outcome, stayed on maintenance chemo and worried about every exam and blood test. Now a year later, and the cancer is back….just started more aggressive chemo this week. Hope your journey is better, but I share your feelings."
PhilosophyExtra5855,There's nothing insensitive about your post. Zero percent.
QuantumConversation,Cancer is the thief of joy.
Necessary_Spray_5217,Friendship can restore the joy.
FakeNickOfferman,"Popsiclesforchickens is right. It can be hard for people to understand. I had chemo for CLL back in 2020. I've been too busy dealing with the after effects -- type 2 diabetes and horrible skin problems -- to worry too much about the cancer. But my SO had breast cancer long ago, like 29 years ago, and she is deathly afraid of recurrence. And she's also had surgeries recently to fix fuck ups from back then. I don't have a solution either. But know you are not alone."
No-Improvement-8760,"I’ve had two bouts of chemo for two different cancers. Reoccurrence is always a possibility but don’t let it steal life from you. It’s hard to have the same quality of life as before the cancer happened. I am still finding my new norm after my last bout. Just give yourself grace and take your time. They don’t know how it feels. Constant paranoia of it coming back. The loss of life and constant what ifs. Start small and work your way up. I’m happy to complete housework or take a drive out of the city. Eventually I’d like to go back to work, and try to be normal again."
Hijak159,I just finished my last triple therapy on Thursday. Hoping for good results on my next CT
Remote-Count-4312,"You can change your attitude over time by using a note method. Every single time you have a negative or unwanted thought - you immediately write down a positive thought. Keep sticky notes, pad of paper or a journal with you. Then make sure you do it every single time. Before bed, brain dump everything into a journal. Write until you can’t anymore. Then you write down 3-5 positive thoughts, goals or hopes. Then go to bed. Don’t do anything else. In the morning, re-read your positives & then write 1-2 more. Then go on with starting your day. Basically you’re retraining your brain to flip the switch from negative to positive. You’ve lived in “fight or flight” mode while handling cancer/chemo. So then you’re stuck in the “I might not have a future” mentality. Thing is… you know you have cancer and it could kill you. But so many people have no clue they have an issue or illness that could kill them. You’ve simply been forced to know info not everyone has, and that’s changed how you approach the world around you. You have every right to celebrate, and at your own pace and in your own way. You are also very entitled to your own feelings & emotions. Be kind with yourself. You’ve been through a lot!!!Give yourself some Grace, compassion & empathy!"
Diligent-Activity-70,Congratulations on making it through 9 months of chemo! I completely understand how you feel and how it feels to have everyone around you celebrating as if everything is over now that you are done with treatment. I don’t know any way to get past these feelings. I hope it helps to hear that many of us have the same feelings 💜
Decent-Patient-1379,"For me, the periods after chemo, when dealing with feelings like yours, were in some ways harder than the chemo's themselves. Therapy can help. Give yourself time, and space. And feel the feelings. I think it is completely normal. You've been through a very traumatic experience. Forced happiness is not gonna help you. I really hope you can express this to (some of) the people around you. It's important they understand. Good luck."
feathernose,"I know how you feel. My last chemo was in march, and i’m just starting to feel better now, for a bit. I’ve been pretty depressed because the chemo did more to my body than i thought. Good chance I’m infertile at age 34 now. My hormones not balanced. You don’t have to be happy, cancer sucks and youbhave the right to feel shitty about it even after finishing your last round of chemo. Chances of recurrence are always there and you will have to carry that with you. But you will find a way to manage. Keep yourself busy, do things that make you happy. It will get better with time."
Terminus_terror,"I'd say it's way more normal to be freaked out than the other around. The trauma you leave with is something else; we just aren't the same after. I know other people don't get it, and hang out with people who do on the days when the feelings are really intense. I hated that cancer took the joy I had, so I got on meds, went to therapy, and did life affirming things in order to move through the fear."
JustSomeKSgirl,"You are not required to participate in toxic positivity. We don’t have to be happy and grateful all the time, especially after our bodies just betrayed us. Being honest about our feelings is much healthier than putting on a fake smile."
ZombiePrestigious443,"I've been out of active treatment for almost two years (just got a lifetime of maintence therapy to go!), and it took me over a year in therapy to get to the point where I could push it aside for a time. Now I just get really bad scananxiety."
OkPassion1810,"When I got my diagnosis, with all the odds I thought I am going to die soon. Rather than thinking the recurrence, why don’t you think that there’s a possibility that you got a second chance? Why don’t you enjoy each and every moment of this second chance? I don’t know how long it’s gonna be for you or me, but we should enjoy everything while we can. Feel free to message me in case you need. We got this :)"
raybecray,You are so real for posting this. I don’t think it makes you a terrible person. Tbh I’m terminal so I’ll prob never be NED but every headache am every pain every itch I wonder if it’s cancer spreading. I’m so hyper aware of my body it’s stressful. I do scans every 3 months and I’m anxious waiting for a scan or Anxious waiting for results. My therapist and I are working on me living in the moment.
AdventurousSleep5461,"After I finished breast cancer treatment I felt the same way, I think it's pretty normal. I mean our bodies decided to try to end us, how can we not be suspicious that they won't do it again? I will say that the further I got from treatment, and the more years NED I had, the more confident I became that I might actually reach old age. Don't stress it, this is normal."
BetterNowThks,"This is normal for any of us who are or have undergone cancer treatment. I'm in treatment and will have chemo 6 of 6 in 2 weeks, them PARP for 3 years. I agreed to have a little celebration when chemo 6 is over but I have a kind of cancer that is almost guaranteed to return. I will never be the same.I'm doing a morning gratitude journal, and it helps, but the idea that a killer isn't coming for me is unrealistic and I can't live in fantasyland to make my family and friends feel better. I tell them I am doing well, and I smile but...the whole ""be happy"" and ""you fought cancer and won,"" thing...Jeez. Have some empathy! Yes have been ravaged by a killer and he's literally sitting in the shadow over here next to me, and he's waiting to attack again, and I am anticipating it, it's on my mind all the time. All the time. All that to say you are not alone."
PhilosophyExtra5855,"I see gratitude as a kind of spiritual muscle we can build, not because we are unrealistic Pollyannas but because it cultivates something good for ourselves to experience, even in bad times--and something not controlled by disease."
Constantlearner01,"This thread is exactly why I tell people I relate more to reddit as a support group than any other outlet. Who knows more about the situation than people in my exact predicament? I finished my chemo last month and found out that is exactly when the depression hits. Most of us were in shock at diagnosis, then made plans for chemo and surgery and by the time that chemo ends, it catches up to us. You have time to breathe and wonder what the hell just happened? I reached out to the cancer clinic psychologist and had a couple appointments so far. I told her that the appointment should’ve been recommended the minute I was diagnosed. I am also disappointed about all the cancer groups that seem to accept donations but have a hard time finding the people they collect for. I didn’t know about many of these groups until after it was all done. One of them reached out to me when I told her my story about diagnosis and she said they have patients talk to med students but it has to be upbeat and positive and there is to be no calling out any medical provider who mishandled or misdiagnosed your cancer. The PARP med seems to be causing depression for me, like a heavy pall. I feel like I’m on the verge of taking a nap every minute of the day. I have two years of this to look forward to. I am NED but it came at a cost. I share your pain."
AndyWarwheels,"When I finished my 6 months of chemo, I was uneasy as well. Then, in my post chemo scans, they found cancer again. My first scans. Now it's been 3 years since my last surgery and I still tip toe but I've learned to live with the fear. It's made me bolder. And more likely to not put things off. So now if I want to do something, learn something, go somewhere. I don't say someday. I do it now. I'm thankful for that fear."
19keightyfour,"Was diagnosed at 22 with Hodgkin Lymphoma and went through 16 rounds of chemo and 30 days of radiation. I’ll be 40 in December and can tell you the feelings you have never go away. It’s kind of like the waxing and waning of the moon; it’s always there, but the degree to which we experience the light changes."
pfflynn,"It will fade a bit but just to the background. I’ve found it best to just be present each day, each moment. If you have folks around you celebrating, join them. They love you and that’s something to celebrate yourself. I know it is highly likely mine will return, so I try to live each day like it is my last."
jw071,"It’s probably a form of PTSD, and yes it will improve. Talking to a therapist may help. I had to stop my first pre-treatment scan because just being the machine freaked me out. I had to get valium prescribed just to go back when normally I can handle almost anything. It goes away with time."
KittyKatHippogriff,"My cancer is stage 4 but I am stable for about 2 years right now. When I finished chemo, I felt like we can do more to tackle it. I had an unusually excellent response. Talking to others, even earlier stage, they have the same feeling. It felt like you just finished a huge battle but all you see is no man’s land. Not the peaceful field that once exist."
Choice_Row9696,"Actually I'm quite jealous of you. I begin my 6 months of chemo on Tuesday. I can't say I understand exactly how you feel, but I do wish I was at the end of this journey and not at the beginning. Maybe it just takes time for the mind to process. You ever kill a disgusting bug, and you know it's dead or flushed down the toilet, but you still feel apprehension every time you enter the room where it was? I guess on that level x 1000, you're subconsciously waiting for the other shoe to drop. And unfortunately, we know cancer can return, but for a lot of people, it doesn't. And let's say worse case scenario, it DOES return. Well, you beat it before and I'm sure you'll do it again. As much as you can, take your victory lap and I'll be praying for you as I'm sure all your well wishers are too."
Save-crochet-1956,"Feel what you feel. You don’t have to be happy for anyone but yourself. You need to take time for self care, prioritizing and figuring out what comes next."
Dying4aCure,"Hugs. You didn't say what kind of cancer, but many of these drugs cause depression. Chemical imbalance depression. I humbly suggest you see if there is a chemical imbalance before you make decisions. I was on Zoloft for four years. I was also severely depressed after a hard chemo. By the time an appointment became available, I was fine again. You do you; you have every right. I have been doing this for eight years now. I am glad I sought help. You may be, too—big hugs. Message me if you like. ❤️"
neeno52,It never goes away.
VirgotheGreat11,Be happy!
Necessary_Spray_5217,"Think how lucky you are. When you got cancer, treatment was available. You made it through! You did your part, which is the best you can do. Be glad and proud. The doctors recommended the best treatment for your condition. Now, be positive. Stress is unhealthy. It weakens your immune system. Be strong and you’ll get stronger!"
WhodatSooner,"Yeah. I’ve been there for a couple of weeks now. I’m having some luck with Iberogast. A lot of the digestive pain ends up being a gas thing but after all of the side effects from all of the stuff we’ve been through, the mind assumes it’s constipation. But no kidding brothers & sisters, the abdominal/ digestive stuff can be worse than the tumor pain (and they might be related). Don’t suffer in silence. ✌️❤️🫵✊"
Accurate-Back-4683,"Thanks for the tip i searched it up, might be handy. I think it was the gassy coke, feels better today, whereas last night kept me awake till the early hours. Think it’s a case of see what works and eliminate stuff as i go along, a few comfortable farts helped tonight and came with ease, and i didn’t apologise to the Mrs either lol."
aligpnw,"I'm sorry OP, I just had to chuckle, if I had 3 cans of Coke in a day, I'm pretty sure I would have literally exploded 😄 Glad you are feeling a little better!"
Accurate-Back-4683,"Thanks, sounds like you’ve had experience of this, or know how it would affect you. It’s a learning curve for sure."
JJB525,"Lots of probiotics. Sourdough bread, cultured yoghurt (I like Greek with honey for breakfast), kimchi, sauerkraut, kombucha, Kefir…..and would you believe it, wheat beer (provided you’re on a regime where you can still partake). You could do the Fodmap to see if there’s anything that is triggering your symptoms. You basically strip what you eat right back to root veg and proteins and slowly reintroduce things to see if they cause you issues. Despite having had an anterior resection, I’ve had absolutely no input from a dietitian any time throughout my treatment, sadly the NHS just leave you to work it out yourself, despite the fact your body has fundamentally changed inside. This isn’t from my local trust but it’s fairly decent as an overview: NHS FodMap Info"
PopsiclesForChickens,"If it makes you feel better when I had a consult with a dietitian, they basically just said try it and if you don't tolerate it, don't eat/drink it. So helpful. /s OP, I don't think there's any set of rules. I can't eat red meat anymore. And I slowly added back in occasional carbonated drinks. But I've also just had to figure out how to live with my new system, which is 7-10 BMs on a good day."
Accurate-Back-4683,"Ps, noted on the wheat beer, sounds interesting. That said we went out for a meal a few days ago i had three pints and some wine when i got home. I don’t think i’ll make a habit of that, i do like a drink but will tone it down."
Accurate-Back-4683,"I’m sorry you had little support, right from when i knew i was going to have a colonoscopy i changed my diet, we thought it was diverticulitis first off so i searched it up. I’ll just avoid coke, and keep the probiotics, it works well. Seems like cos of the pressure on the bowel it seems almost every time i eat i need a poo, like it’s not satisfied, i think it’s just bad choices last night. Think i had a day or two off the probiotics, but now i’ll be on it regularly."
Spicy_Mango04,"I'm 20F. I was diagnosed at 19 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, June 1st 2023. doesn't really have stages but my bone marrow was over 80% cancer. I had a fwb who stayed with me when I got my diagnosis and we started dating, we've been together over a year now. I don't have any kids and likely won't be able to have any because I didn't have time to freeze my eggs, but I do have a cat. I've been in remission since July 2023 and I'm in my maintenance phase, should be done June 2025"
leftcoastwifet,My daughter was 2 years 7 months old when she was diagnosed with stage 4 neuroblastoma. Obviously unmarried and no kids - she has an older sister though. She’s been fighting for 8 years…. 2 relapses…. So so many treatments… but she is an amazing child. Perfect in so many ways. Unbelievably funny and sweet. Makes friends everywhere. Loves to snuggle and sing. She is our miracle! She has been clear for almost 4 years now. 🫶🏼🎗️

Faunas-bestie,"I am stage 4 metastatic soft tissue sarcoma with lung nodules. After finding my lung nodules and determining they were metastatic disease, I had six rounds of doxorubicin and ifosfamide and they basically disappeared. Five months later, they came back with a vengeance. The good news is the ones I have are all at or close to 1 CM, and these are considered small. Check if they sized any of your nodules. Anything under a centimeter is still very small. Also, if you haven’t talked to your care team yet, take a deep breath and relax. My new mantra is “Don’t freak out till you find out”. I know this is worrisome, but you’ll have plenty of time to worry after they do a biopsy. My history tells me if the nodules are small, they may ask you to wait 3 months to do another CT scan, to see if they’ve grown. Most people find the nodules are behaving and you can then decide if you want radiation or surgery. You have plenty of time, my friend. Breast cancer is the most well-researched and supported cancer there is. There are so many more treatments and chemos available to you that have been tested and effective. I’m sending you calming hugs and understanding."
Pharm_Girl93,"Thank you so much for your response! One is 7mm, one is 9mm, and one is 15mm (1.5 cm). I know the two are considered small but close to that cutoff. Trying to be very positive. It just seems like bad surprise after bad surprise, especially when the original surgery was considered a success with full removal and good margins. Your message helped a lot though. I hope overall that you are doing well and hanging in there. I'm sending all the positive thoughts I can 💕"
dirkwoods,"What does your doctor say? Follow them, PET scan, biopsy, something else? Do you have an Oncology Psychologist to help you manage the ups and downs? Difficult as it is to believe there are people out there that have done nothing but speak with cancer patients 50 hours a week for the last 20 years. They can be very helpful."
Pharm_Girl93,"My physician has not called me with the results and unfortunately may not until Tuesday due to the holiday weekend here. I do not have an oncology psychologist at this time. When I started this journey last year, everyone filled me with such hope and made it sound like it was going to be a year of hard work and then mostly smooth sailing. That's part of why I underwent the elective mastectomy, to reduce chances of ever dealing with it again. When, in fact, it's not even clear that I'll even be in remission or ""clear"" again."
Swimming_Leg_2644,Sending you wishes and a speedy recovery!!
Pharm_Girl93,Thank you so much!
Spfromau,"I am sorry you are going through this awful period of uncertainty. I have stage 4 cancer (not breast), and when I was initially diagnosed, I had a 5mm nodule on my left lung. While it was there on scans 3 months later (stable), it has since disappeared, and I assume was due to an infection or something, rather than being a metastasis."
Pharm_Girl93,"I'm so sorry that you are going through this, but this gives me a lot of hope. This is my 4th chest surgery since mid April. I just keep telling myself that 1. There could be many other possibilities and 2. I know the primary tumor was gone between mid April and early June because we had to do several additional surgeries and the pathology for all was clean. It seems crazy to me (though I know not impossible) that the primary tumor grew for more than 4 months between being found and my diagnosis and didn't so much as touch a lymph node but in the span of a month? Maybe 2? It was able to regrow and cause multiple mets? I know this is just me convincing myself right now, but we gotta do what we gotta do to survive and there is nothing I can do without more information. I so appreciate you sharing! All of the comments have really made me see a little bit of reason and realize that I don't know much yet."
This-Army6223,"I wouldn't have read the results. I never looked at my reports until I was sitting with the doctor. But since you already did, just know that I had a solid lymph node at my collar bone after having a mastectomy. I totally lost my mind. They scanned it and it was a solid mass. They surgically removed it and biopsied it and it was nothing, just what they called a benign ""reactive node"". Idk why it was solid but it was nothing at all. That was in 2011. Also immunotherapy can cause massive lung nodules. I imagine other drugs can too. I know someone whose lungs were full of them after keytruda and now they are all gone. So don't panic now. Do you have Xanax or Ativan you can take for this weekend?"
Pharm_Girl93,"I know better than to read them but it's so hard! Everyone was really sure they'd all come back negative and I was, foolishly, hoping for some positive news going into the long weekend 😅. That makes me feel much better. I am currently receiving Keytruda and have been since November, and I know one of my other chemos also carried a risk of lung impact. I'm telling myself that today, I am healthy and feel good. These nodules could have been there for months for all I know. So I'm going to keep on living my life until I'm told otherwise! I do not unfortunately but my husband has the day off and my best friend (who is an invasive ductal carcinoma survivor herself) is coming to spend the weekend with us. I just need to keep my head up ☺️ I appreciate your response so much though! I'm so glad your results were negative and hope you are doing well."
Still_Falcon9705,Husband just underwent treatment for salivary gland tumor stage 4 now it’s metastasized to lymph nodes and now he has lung cancer. We have to wait until the 12th to talk about to them about it. We are at a nationally recognized cancer center. We trust our team and we are following their lead. The nurse who called me said stay off the lab results in the my chart app and sit tight there are a lot of treatments out there and clinical trials. My husband is back to doing everything he loves for now and if you can you should do the same thing. 🙏🏽💖💕🙏🏽
Pharm_Girl93,"Thank you for the advice! Unfortunately, I'm semi restricted due to being less than two weeks out from my mastectomy. However, I've been able to do little things 🥰 I recognized that morning major is going to change in 4ish days so I should do my best not to think about it. I'm thinking of you and your husband!"
CartographyWho,"Hi, I gather from your post and comments that you have TNBC. There's another sub r/breastcancer where we hang out. Come join us, we're a very supportive and smart crowd. Either way, others here have given the best advice. I really loved calling it Schrodinger's results and treating it as excellent until proven otherwise. Do enjoy your long weekend, keep busy, and see you on the other side 😀"
Dijon2017,"You have been given great advice! This subreddit is awesome. You may also want to consider joining r/breastcancer. One of the worst parts of being diagnosed with cancer is the fear and anxiety it can cause if or when you experience a change in your body, abnormal lab values or have “findings” on an imaging test. It’s actually normal to think if it could be related to your cancer. Believe it or not, sometimes these things are benign and have no clinical significance. As others have said, try to enjoy the long weekend with your husband and best friend as much as possible. Do things that bring you joy. And don’t forget that laughter is good medicine. Wishing for you only the best!"
natgastek67,Look up Dr. Thomas Seyfried and Dr. Valter Longo. They both discuss the metabolic theory of cancer. Watch all their stuff and email them. They will respond. My daughter is 28 with stage 4 so we've been through it all.
Whatasaurus_Rex,"My loved one has had several small, but stable lung nodules for almost two years now. One was biopsied and it was benign. The others are too small to check, but the fact that they’ve remained stable before, during, and after treatment has been reassuring."
Pharm_Girl93,"I'm so glad to hear that these are stable for your loved one! This does make me feel better certainly. I know I didn't have these prior to treatment but we have not checked since then, which was a year ago, so they could have developed really at any time."
AncientSmoke241,"I don't either. I learned my melanoma was back and stage 4 with mets to lung in May. I told my family and swore them all to secrecy. Then I told a few of my best friends, none of which live in my town, and swore them all to secrecy too. I figured I would wait a while to tell others, but the longer I go, the less I want to tell anyone else. In fact, I regret telling the few friends that I did tell. Not sure why I don't want people to know, but almost none that I told reacted in a way that felt good, and it feels strangely uncomfortable to be around them now. And yes, I did cry. Hard not to."
BetterNowThks,"Nope. If they haven't had any shit go down in their life yet, it's coming. Everyone has something. Its cancer for you now, but try to assume that your friends don't think that they are perfect and that you are somehow not just because this is happening to you. If they're really your friends, they are going to rally around you. Allow yourself to be vulnerable. Be honest about your fears and feelings. Give your friends a chance to be your friends."
Independent_Team827,Exactly my thoughts
Disastrous_Hour_6776,Then don’t - we chose who to tell .
Seoul_Man-44,"I feel you. I am about nine months post-treatment. I have playing hide ans seek since diagnosis. Many invites but I can't make it because of ""work, will be out of town, already had plans, etc..."" One of my buddies called me a few weeks ago to tell me about a great position that just opened up at his company. Was appreciative but felt I had to share the reason why I couldn't pursue. When he broke down and told me he had to call me back, it really hurt. To be honest, I am tearing up now just thinking about it... Felt a little validated I haven't shared the news. This situation we are in sucks ass. Unfortunately, there is no right or wrong way to address the path forward. It's going to come out eventually. That said, do it on your own terms as you are the one in recovery - physically, mentally and emotionally."
AdventurousSleep5461,"I was really open about it the first time... And a lot of people in my life disappeared. It sucked, but I guess the trash took itself out? I dunno. People get really weird when you tell them you have cancer, so be aware that you may lose some friends in this process. Up front everyone was all super supportive, but then it became crickets as things went on. I don't say that to deter anyone from sharing their diagnosis, but to let you know that if people go missing it's absolutely not you. It's 100% them. But you will find that you'll make new friends in the cancer community and those friendships are really supportive because they just get it more than the cancer muggles do."
DecompressionIllness,"I initially wanted to keep mine secret but I ended up telling my friends because they'd wonder what was going on when I'd be away for periods of time. I didn't cry while telling them. I wanted them to know that other than the diagnosis, I was OK. I cried to all of my nurses instead."
dirkwoods,"Tell who you want, what you want, when you want. It gets much easier as the profound reality sinks in with you. No rush in most circumstances. You will have more info later."
WhodatSooner,"Then don’t. I told four people: my two closest friends and two of my former law partners. I asked them all to keep it to themselves. Two did, two clearly didn’t and I know which two didn’t based on who else I heard from. I don’t think you should feel like you have to tell anyone who doesn’t absolutely need to know."
DiceQueen69,I told those closest to me once my diagnosis was confirmed. I have never actively told people just to tell them. I told the ones that cared enough to notice that I hadn't been around as much.
Alienspacedolphin,"Yes- it can be hard talking to others. You don’t have to. It’s tough telling people and dealing with their emotions. But if you want them to know and it’s just to hard on you, you can tell one person and have them let others know. That way you don’t have to deal with all the initial emotion."
Independent_Team827,Well some of mine disappeared it’s called cancer ghosting. I didn’t cry they did and then I knew poof they were gone but remember friends like that were not really friends at all . I met new friends through my cancer support groups and we get together not just to talk about cancer we do things. So it’s your choice to tell them my opinion they will find out anyway . I mean whats a friend for if you can’t tell them that and get support from them. Just because they just had a child or came back is irrelevant they are friends because you could tell them anything . That’s my opinion anyway I wish you well on this journey and stay positive because I’m in remission.
BigMikeAltoona,My friends and family have been great and supportive. Feeling the extra love while going through this has been very helpful for me.
OnlyTheGoodDieYun,Do what you feel is right there is no wrong answer here. You get to decide.
Poem_Upstairs,"Tbh I didn’t tell most people this time? Told my closest family, some very close friends and my therapist but am just… not vibing with doing all that again. May not be the best course of action but it feels right for me right now"
mthoody,"I decided early on to be an open book. I consider the “cone of silence” a burden on those keeping the secret. Anyway, that approach worked well for me. I could understand work dynamics that could call for the cone of silence, but I was self-employed. Nobody cried. Nobody ghosted. But I’m M57 and my circle of friends goes back to childhood."
Expensive_Ninja_7797,"A lot of people you were counting on will bail on you. And a lot of people you’d never expect to will rally hardcore to your side. And there’s no way to predict who will do what. I found out about my stage IV prostate cancer (PSA of 1096) with mets to kidneys, bladder, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and extensively in my bones a little over a year ago. We have a big family (I have 2 brother and 3 sisters). Everyone at first was pretty normal about it, but it didn’t take long for people to start disappearing. One of my brothers and one sister convinced my mom I was faking it (which is strange because my mom was in the hospital for one of my surgeries and spoke with my oncologist. I haven’t spoken to my mom or the others in since Jan. The crazy thing is, my oldest sister and I hadn’t spoken in years. Like, a lot of years. 10 maybe. And now she’s the only family member I speak to. Some people just react super weird to it. And you never know which ones. A girl I went to middle school with has become my best supporter. She had a rare type of brain cancer a while back, and when she heard I was going to MD Anderson, she reached out to me. That’s where she had gone. We hadn’t spoken in 30+ years (I was 49 when I was diagnosed), and now we speak almost everyday. Who you tell and when is 100% up to you. You don’t have to do or say anything. It’s your cancer, it’s your health, it’s your life. You don’t owe anything to anyone regarding this subject. You do what’s best for you and health."
Intelligent-Cow5384,"Didn’t tell my friends till surgery was completed. Honestly, didn’t plan on crying, but somehow it came out. So, I will just keep to myself now. A bit embarrassing to cry"
Available_Music_4367,"It depends on you, your friends and your relationship. There is no right or wrong choice in my opinion. Telling my friends has made cancer real and helping me process and their messages and calls of support have been invaluable to me at the start of my journey."
Displaced_in_Space,"Yes. This is perfectly normal. I named it ""The Wait."" You get told you have cancer, but other than the name of it, you know nothing. This is the absolute worst time in the entire cancer journey (with scanxiety being a close second.). The best you can do is call the oncologist office and tell them you'd like to schedule an appointment and that you have a referral. The date that they give you will likely be a couple weeks away. Tell them you'd like to be kept on a list for cancellations, and if it's possible for you/your mom, tell the office that you can get to their office quickly for any last minute cancellations. MD Anderson is literally one of the 5 best cancer hospitals in the United States."
alfriel,Thank you! That makes me feel a bit better that the wait is normal. I have heard that about MD Anderson but I wasn't sure if that was just their main Texas location that's the best. The one near me is Cooper university with I think some sort of partnership with MD Anderson
WalkingHorse,Very normal. Very scary but ‘The Wait’ as coined above happens to many on this journey. The pulmonologist will leave the staging to the oncologist. Make sure she gets biomarker testing (liquid and tissue if possible) before starting treatment! Best to your mom. 🤍
alfriel,"Thank you so much! I didn't even know about biomarker testing until right now, I will look into it!"
Rallyks,"My mom had surgery to remove a tumor June 19. Tests confirmed it was cancerous about a week later, but didn’t get to meet with an oncologist until August 12. We’re still waiting to meet with a hepatologist to see if it’s okay to start Gleevec. It will be almost 3 months since diagnosis. The waiting SUCKS, but it seems like this is the norm. Hoping for the best for you and your mother"
alfriel,"Thank you, and same to you and yours 💜"
Just_Dont88,"I had a blood transfusion on a Tuesday and was referred to an oncologist and was told it wouldn’t be until the next week before I could get an appointment, luckily I had was able to be seen that Friday. Got a bone marrow biopsy and diagnosed with Acute Leukemia that evening. Admitted to the hospital that night and started chemo that Monday. My cancer is very aggressive and was very fortunate to be seen so quickly because I literally was dying. Still had to wait for testing to come back for them to know exactly what they were dealing with and exact treatment but chemo had to be started quickly. Definitely be on a cancellation list that can help."
cancerkidette,"Totally get this and had ALL myself, but acute blood cancers are a totally different treatment protocol than any solid tumour I am aware of, so our routes into chemo are usually by default way way quicker than most other patients. So it’s kind of apples to oranges. OP’s wait is pretty normal - for a solid tumour."
alfriel,Thank you for sharing! I'm so glad that it was caught and treated quickly for you 💜
phonograhy,"This was sadly and frustratingly also what happened when my mom was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The waiting when you don't have all the relevant info is the worst part, and you should try your best not to dwell on it. Also it's unlikely that anyone knows what her staging is yet, that'll need to be determined by the oncologist/mdt. For now, breathe and rally. I'm sure there will be challenges ahead, but today there's nothing left to do but wait."
oneshoesally,Yes. The oncology office is highly unlikely to tell you anything over the phone if you have not yet been seen by them at all. Think about it- every patient they see has cancer. You aren’t going to get a rush response out of them unless you are their patient undergoing their treatment. This is perfectly normal. You are actually very fortunate to get in that quickly. Some of us endured much longer anxious waits!
alfriel,"We did see the oncologist and established care before the biopsy result was in. He said it was unlikely to be cancer based on the CT, but the biopsy confirmed it is. I guess I just had the impression that things would move quickly as he ordered the EBUS Stat. That makes me sad that people have to wait such a long time for care 😔"
FatLilah,"Waiting is unfortunately normal, but I wanted to add that you shouldn't hesitate to seek a second opinion or a consultation with an oncologist at a different treatment center if you're not happy with the first oncologist. It really helps when you feel like you're in good hands, that you trust your team and the communication is good. And it looks like you have access to some very good cancer centers. Maybe you can research and see who specializes in your mom's cancer, or what treatment options are available at different centers. Some of them have a lot of supportive options, like integrative oncologists and some have specialized equipment like proton radiation or whatever. Don't feel shy about getting her the best possible care 🧡"
Opening-Kick7411,"Sorry to hear. I go to Abramson, but also am getting second opinions fromJohn Hopkins and Jefferson (Sidney Kimmel ) . Jefferson has been one of the leading hospitals for heart and lung, and is only 4 short blocks from Pennsylvania Hospital ( Abramson) Good luck"
mfatty2,"I was in treatment, completed it, had my 3 month post PET scan. It came back showing disease still. I scheduled at appointment before the end of July. My oncologist couldn't get me in until yesterday. It's normal unfortunately. Luckily it gave me time to set up an appointment at Mayo for next week so I will have a second opinion on treatment. Which I would've done regardless for a recurrent diagnosis. But it was still nerve wracking"
alfriel,I'm so sorry you're going through that! It's such a shame that things don't move quicker with such a difficult illness to have. I wish you well with your treatment and recovery 💜
funkygrrl,"I don't agree that this is normal. Generally they make an appointment right away. However, you won't be scheduled to see the doctor immediately - it will probably be a week later or so. Pick an oncologist at a large volume teaching hospital."
RelationshipQuiet609,"I had a Pet Scan on August 22. I don’t get the results until Sept. 6 and I have had the same oncologist for years! So it’s everywhere, hurry up and wait. Also, you must make sure your Mother is the one calling. They will not call you back due to HIPA laws, unless your mother has signed consent that they can speak to you."
doofdoofies,I'm sending good vibes your way. Your mother is so young too. I hope she pulls through
alfriel,Thank you 💜
PartisansArmes,"The key thing about care is to always ask the patient (your mom) how they feel about the care and whether or not they feel there is a problem with the quality of care. Typing the cancer does take time (2-3 weeks) and it is critical because it gives the oncologist an idea of the treatment they will use to fight the cancer. While it's difficult, I strongly recommend shying away from looking at percetnages/survival rates etc as treatment has changed significantly in the last few years and the rates that you will find on the internet aren't typically filtered for age and they often are from 5+ years ago.. The reality is that the only things your mom can control are her diet and exercise. Everything else is out of her control."
alfriel,"It's so hard not to look, but I know it's not good for anything. They did call me back, and she is going to be seen this upcoming week, so things seem to be moving very quickly based on the experiences shared from others here about their wait times, and I am very grateful for that. Thanks for sharing your insights with me!"
Still_Falcon9705,I would go to Md. Anderson but cancer treatment planning anywhere takes time. The put my husband into a priority que and that took 2 weeks. We just got more cancer news and it will be two weeks before they have time for a telehealth appointment. We do a lot of telehealth and only go in for actual treatment.
alfriel,"I'm so sorry to hear about your husband and the long waits 😔 we haven't been offered telehealth visits as of yet, but it's good to know that it may occur during this process."
Sundevil31159,Md Anderson was ranked #1 in the country
pinkpeony90,"I have lung nodules since 2022, and they have grown but I’m always told it’s no big deal. This scares me because I’ve had cancer two times already, and now my oxygen level is low and nothing like before and I wish they would do more tests on these. I also have liver lessions, 2 were found in ER as accidental finding. I went to my cancer center because of my colon cancer, and they found that the lesions have grown and there’s actually four instead of 2. So they do a MRI which was inconclusive, and they’re too hypo dense whatever that means and not normal. So they have to monitor them. My question is why not just do a biopsy and get an answer for me then. I don’t like waiting and not knowing. I’m always in pain. Vomiting and so forth. We will see October on my repeat tests. I’m so sorry what you’re going through and I’ll pray that it all turns out fine and Jesus takes control. You are so sweet and amazing towards your mom. ❤️❤️"
alfriel,"I'm so sorry to hear what you're going through! I hope that your nodules are not cancerous, but that is so frustrating that they haven't done a biopsy. My mom's health has been declining for several years, and she just gets passed around from specialist to specialist with no real help until this recent ER visit. Unfortunately the Healthcare system in the US is extremely difficult to navigate and I have worked with doctors who expressed difficulties in what they're able to do for their patients as far as testing, they are heavily restricted by hospital policies and health insurance, whose number 1 priority is to make as much money as possible. We had a specialist recently say that she really needs an MRI due to spinal issues from degenerative disease and frequent falls but they can't order it until she goes through Physical Therapy for 6 weeks, 2-3 times a week and then has a f/u x-ray - only then will they be able to order what they already know is necessary. It just feels like so many hoops to jump through that delays critical treatment to improve one's quality of life and longevity. I wish I had any sort of helpful advice to share with you. Perhaps if you don't have a pulmonologist already, find a good one that is trained to perform the EBUS procedure. That went very smoothly for my mom and she has oxygen problems as well, usually O2 is 88-94 on 2-4 liters of oxygen. Thank you, and I will pray for you as well for good news on your test results 💜"

dirkwoods,"Common. Yesterday isn't fast enough for us, a few weeks is rushing it for providers with already overbooked schedules. Unlike a heart attack or stroke a few to several weeks is very unlikely to make a difference in outcome. Hopefully, that helps a tiny bit."
alfriel,"It does help put it into perspective, thank you!"

Electrical_Paint5568,Lots of stories about this type of surgery over at r/kidneycancer It's luck of the draw sometimes. You can do all the right things and still get sick.
montanawildcat,"I received my stage 4 RCC CC with METS to the adrenal gland, both lungs and brain 12/31/23. They didn’t take my kidney but I had 6 rounds of radiation on the tumors in my brain that were killing me 1/29/24. Craniotomy 1/30 to remove the three largest tumors. Opdivo and Yervoy every three weeks for 4 months, now Opdivo every four weeks. I’ve been fortunate that my body has reaponded well to the immunotherapy. Godspeed as you get started on this bullshit journey."
Crazy-Garden6161,"I had a radical nephrectomy 2 years ago at age 51. My recovery was pretty easy. First few days were rough from abdominal pain, so getting out of bed/chairs was tough. I walked a lot which I’m sure helped (it was part of my discharge instructions). I had surgery on Thursday, felt like myself again (with just minor pain) by the next Wednesday. Was back at work two weeks after surgery (I have a desk job) with a weight restriction of 20 lbs for another month. Hope this helps!"
Terrible-Big-Baby888,Will be thinking of you. Close in age to when I was diagnosed with Stage 4 breast cancer. All I can say is—we are so so so much stronger than we know. And lean on your loved ones. Let people help you & your wife & daughter. I pray everything goes well 💗
NoDeparture7207,"That's very kind, thank you ❤️"
Charming_Banana_714,"My husband had a radical nephrectomy March 6, and has been having immunotherapy infusions of Keytruda every 3 weeks for 1st year. So far so good. Adrenal gland was removed also. His mass as 9.4 cm. 3 month scans were clear for metastasis. Have our 6 month scans next month. Only issues he has had was a rash over the surgical area, a little nausea a day or 2 after the infusions and fatigue. All in all, he’s doing amazing. Still does his own lawn and other household needs. Good luck to you. Stay positive! That’s half the battle."
Charming_Banana_714,"He was stage 3, clear cell carcinoma with pathology report. No chemo or radiation was needed. 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽"
sunrise_parabellum,Are they going to do genetic testing? Lynch syndrome has increased risk of renal cancer and a whole bunch more
NP_huh,"Stay strong! I know it’s easier said than done. I’m 31 with metastatic RCC (this pest is everywhere). Got diagnosed in April. Have gone through radiation and my immunotherapy cycles every 3 weeks. Lots of side effects but body is responding well (slowly but surely). And I totally understand what you feel. It’s very different when you’re the patient. Mainstream media portrays cancer like the endgame. But medicine has advanced so much. And if you have a good support system and people rooting for you, you are so so lucky. It sucks, no doubt. I’m not the same person anymore. I had a very active lifestyle, I used to power lift, I still have my job but I’m on a sabbatical. I loved going for dinners. But the disease has changed me. It’s the energy levels and side effects from the treatments. Was on corticosteroids that made me gain a lot of weight. But I dunno, maybe I’m delusional sometimes, but I see myself getting back to my old life slowly. Really slowly, but surely. I’d like to wish you luck on your journey!!"
Crissup,"I had a partial nephrectomy due to clear cell RCC 10 years ago. They originally wanted to perform a radical nephrectomy because it looked like the tumor was right up against the renal artery, however, a radiologist friend of mine reviewed my scans and told me he felt there was enough clearance for a sufficiently skilled surgeon to get between the tumor and renal artery. Ultimately, the surgeon (32 years of experience) decided he was willing to try, but told me he was going in old school. No robot or laparoscopic. Pathology was in the OR and confirmed that he was able to get it all without removing the bottom half of the kidney, but he did take the adrenal. Two years later, I was back in the OR for the opposite adrenal due to metastases. This past December, my pulmonologist finally got his interventional guy to go deeper into my windpipe to biopsy some lung nodules. Sure enough, it was the kidney cancer, so I’m now in Pazopanib, which has shrunk the nodules 40% in 3 months."
e-gal25,"36 here! Has my surgery last summer 2023 for a 4cm stage 1 grade 2 ccrcc. They did not remove any lymph nodes or adrenal gland.. I’ve been trying to eat healthier and watching what additives are in the food I buy, download YUKA, you scan an item and it shows what hazardous additives are in there then it’ll give you alternatives to buy instead. My journey has changed me and I have fear of recurrence and sometimes end up googling and YouTubing and watching TikTok of peoples journey.. not a day goes by where I’m not reminded of ccrcc… but I’m grateful I’m still here and praying I live to age 80+. I did genetic testing and it was clear"
No-Recognition5313,"I'm not in the same boat, but I literally just had a guest on my podcast that beat stage 4 lung cancer using these stem cells activating patches. She has other stories like that, but I myself remain a bit skeptic. However, if I was in your shoes, I would try anything and everything whether or not it's western med or holistic. I would do both, but that's just me. Let me know if you want anymore info, I don't want to spam anything that's not wanted on this thread."
DerkSC,Stay strong 👍🏻
Just_Dont88,"I was diagnosed with B Cell Leukemia at 35 at the end of July 2024. Still feels like I’m way too young for this. I really think being around chemicals and in the Navy probably played a part. I’ve never smoked, never a big drinker. I think you can play right and still be dealt wrong. Stay strong!"
Durgesh28,"Brother, come to India. Take medicine from ayurveda doctor Shailesh Rousha from Sarakpur, Greater Noida, Uttar pradesh, India. See his youtube channel too. Aaj me for further help if wanted."
