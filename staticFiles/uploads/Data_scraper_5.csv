Justawoman76,I’m sorry you have to go through this and it is destroying your health and body. It really sucks and you have every right to feel the way you feel. Just know you’re not alone. Lots of love and hugs for you!,216
JustAStudent254,"I know that I am not alone and that sadly there are probably people with a similar story, but it just sucks... I had a rough childhood and finally had the chance to follow my passions, martial arts and game design. Martial arts is mostly out of the picture (I could still coach/be a ref) and game design has constantly been delayed basically. I know not everything is completely lost, but the frustration gets to me after years of this stuff. Any time I think I can catch a break and I can focus on life again it's just there again. I have lost so much, but I don't need it all back. I would just pay everything I have to be normal again",647
JellyFast,"Thank you for this. I am going through a similar situation. Cancer fucking ruined me. I feel guilty for complaining about it. I should be happy to be alive. I’m told I should be grateful, but I’m not. I’m resentful. I hate that no one prepared me for life after cancer. It’s destroyed my marriage. Destroyed me from being intimate. Ruined my body. I’m so resentful. I don’t feel normal and fear I never will. I also hate what cancer did to you, me, and everyone. I’m sorry for your struggles. I can relate.",516
commonlyknownaskind,"I was just thinking about posting exactly what you have described. Cancer has ruined my world. I don’t feel guilty talking about it and I don’t feel lucky just to be alive (as I am told often). There is something to be said for quality of life. My marriage imploded during my treatment, he wanted a whole person. I have lasting side effects that impact every part of my life. I can no longer take a simple walk without pain. I went from being told I was beautiful to now being told I have a pretty face because my body has been destroyed by 4 surgeries and two hormone based cancers in two years. Cancer is not fair or equal. I feel like I can atleast post this sentiment here. I feel for all of us that lost so much on a journey we never thought we’d have to be a part of.",783
sadsnoopymusic,"To get cancer when you’re just healing from a shitty upbringing really feels like a kick in the teeth. You don’t deserve the horrible experiences with it you’ve had. I’m so sorry. I’m glad you’re expressing yourself here. Here is a little haiku (by a poet called Issa) that I tell myself in dark times when I realise how far behind I am from where I thought I would be in my life by now: O snail, Climb Mount Fuji But slowly, slowly!",471
Junior-Let567,I’m sorry this has been so rough on you. Makes me feel sort and of petty now for complaining how chemo turned my hair white and left me with joint pain.,162
JustAStudent254,"Just because I might have it worse doesn't mean you can't complain. Complain all you want my friend, because comparing sorrows to each other will only lead to more.",174
justlookingokgeez,"Cancer is the worst. It's absolutely awful, and no one deserves the pain and bullshit it brings. I relate to everything you said, and while I have nothing else to offer, please know that I'm also screaming into the void with you, friend.",247
alegeee,"hey, i’m similar to you right now, i can’t even get into my dream school because of what cancer did to me. i know your struggles, but please keep sharing, nothing gets better when bottling up.",202
mywilliswell95,"Cancer sucks. You rule dude. Just hang in there alright. We can’t control everything, we can only respond to events with our actions and that’ll help determine our outcomes. Be strong.",194
gabagool_____,"i have no words to help, but i just wanna send my love your way. i’m so sorry you’re dealing with this. hugs 🫂",120
GeneralTonight2401,"28M with stage 4 astrocytoma I wanted to end my life when I got diagnosed. I went from backpacking overseas to barely able to leave my room back in the US. I’ve been going through radiation and chemo and both of them have been killing me and making it very unmotivating to return back to normal life. Nothing worse than being sick constipated and sleep deprived at the same time. I’m almost at my one-year mark since my diagnosis and I will be continuing to travel With the little time I have left. my parents are very concerned for me and my physical health but in my mind I’d rather do the things I want to do even if it hurts then just sit around and rot, waiting to die. Hopefully you can finish what you need to get finished and conquer your disease enough to get back on track with some normalcy. you’re right in saying “I don’t want to die from this disease” and you shouldn’t",893
commonlyknownaskind,"I hope you do get to still travel and have little bursts of joy- even if it means pushing through the pain. Ive been all over the USA in the last year. I hurt, need lots of naps and I move very slowly but I’ve had the most amazing experiences. My family and friends have been so patient and kind. I wish this for you too!",331
play3xxx1,"Please try to enjoy what you can however small your body n mind allows you to . Like music , tv shows or books . The more you think of how your life would without cancer , the more frustrating it will be for you",221
JustAStudent254,"I still try. Still a big fan of games and brute forced muscle memory to be able to use my keyboard again (couldn't feel the keys at all, now I luckily can feel it somewhat so that makes it easier). I know there is a lot of good in the world and lots of exciting stuff to experience, but I can't ignore the cancer when it's the reason I can't go to a party due to being unable to get there, or when I want to hold someone's hand not being able to feel their hand... it's rough man. There are days that are good, but there are days like these where I just can't look past it",582
kaskadegirl,Hey there. I am sorry that you've been dealing with this. Cancer is a biatche. You are fuckin strong. Sorry for my language but 6.5 years is a long time to deal with everything cancer brings. Praying for you to get some kind of normal. ❤️,248
bros402,have you been checked for LFS or NF-1? Have you gone to MD Anderson in Houston?,96
petey44444,Prayers sent up,25
Baron_von_chknpants,"I fucking hate the aftermath of chemo. Neuropathy in my hands and feet, it's exacerbated and probably accelerated the development and symptoms of an as yet unknown arthritis variant (some inflammatory one but not certain, so will see rheumatologist in a week) and probably EDS. My GI tract is just fucked all over, I get repeated pain flares and a week of shitting myself bloody, with the bonus of gastritis. But, I also see myself as lucky. It didn't kill me, but it did my sister. I try and push through every day in her memory (may it be a blessing).",577
