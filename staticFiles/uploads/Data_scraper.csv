0,Diligent-Activity-70,"I'm sure you don't want to hear this, but it is completely her choice. It's her disease in her body and she has the right to treat it or not. We see this all the time where the family disagrees and wants to force someone to do what they think is best. Sometimes the family wants alternative medicine; sometimes the family is opposed to alternative medicine or opposed to the individual declining any further treatments... Having cancer does not take away an individual's autonomy. It doesn't make us incapable of understanding the severity of our circumstances, nor does it prevent us f from making informed decisions. She doesn't have to get tests that she doesn't want. She doesn't have to make the same treatment choices that you THINK you would make if you had cancer (you don't know until you're in the position). She can choose to see her Chinese medical practitioner if that's what she is comfortable with.",944
1,FartnSpartn,"I can’t comprehend how difficult it is to undergo chemo, I would leave treatment entirely up to her. But I don’t think it is unreasonable to try to convince her of getting a biopsy especially because she was previously open to it (wasn’t able to find appointments at that time).",288
2,danijay637,"The best way to understand her feelings is listen to her. Ask questions with an open mind . And learn to be okay if she says things you may not agree with. She is the patient and it’s her life. For instance, instead of saying something like “ you should go to the doctor.” Ask “would you be open to seeing what the doctor recommends?”",351
3,sk7515,"I would ask her what her fears are. Talking to someone, listening to their feelings (and really listening, not being dismissive) might help them to look at pros and cons. But find out what she is afraid of. Is it pain? Is it losing hair from chemo? Is it fighting only to lose? But talk openly, and really listen to her opinion in a non judgmental way. Ultimately it is her decision because it’s her body.",415
4,Conflicted_Nebula,"Are there patient groups around? Or better, patient groups with a religious background? Listening to other’s experience might help",140
5,PurpleFlame8,Your best bet would probably be to find a pro western medicine eastern medicine practitioner. One who will do acupuncture and suction cups if she wants but who will also encourage her to do conventional treatment or insist she also do conventional treatment.,268
6,I_ask_questions_thx,"I would suggest you sit down and tell her no one will force her to do anything but if she’s willing to tell you what she is worried about, what she’s heard and what she understands of the situation. Don’t assume anything and fully understand her mindset so you have a basis and context. Next, tell her no one is going to make her do anything she doesn’t want to but if she is religious then maybe prayer is answered in mysterious ways. What if you being a caring child is the universes way of sending help. At the very least ask her if you can talk to a specialist without committing to treatment to understand the situation and have them explain survival risk. If it really is stage 2c I think chemo/radiation is probably the treatment and or surgery depending on size and location. Though if she’s not willing to get treatment I can understand why she would want to avoid surgery and chemo/radiation. Those are things you can discuss with the doctor to find something that is less invasive. It really needs to be her own decision because if she’s pressured into it, you would need to deal with the regret of pressuring her into a treatment that made her suffer. If it really is stage 2c I personally think it’s worth a shot. Also! A biopsy is usually not as invasive as you think. It’s a needle biopsy no surgery. And if she has a genetic mutation test positive she can take a pill daily for a few years",1485
7,Taytoh3ad,"Let her live and die by her own terms. You’ve said your piece to her, she has refused. She is still competent to decide her own healthcare. Support and love her, and don’t make this about yourself and your emotions, like you’re trying to do. It’s ok to let it go.",273
8,JRLDH,"She has stage 2 and is listening to a quack. I'm sorry, it's a bit callous to just say ""let her live and die by her own terms"". Yes, if she were stage 4 and hopeless but not stage 2 and hocus-pocus medical advice.",223
9,Electronic-Syrup-385,Having the pastor talk some sense into her sounds like your best bet. I’m going through chemo with stage 3b stomach cancer and while it’s not easy it is worth doing. She can do traditional medicine and chemotherapy,224
10,Meeelou,My dad has stage 3B lung cancer. There are people living years with immunotherapy and targeted therapies. I have spent so much time researching and learning and advocating. It’s overwhelming to say the least. I’m grateful I’m a nurse practitioner and have the ability to interpret data. Please feel free to message me if you have questions or just need to talk!,371
11,FartnSpartn,I will definitely shoot you a message! Thank you for the words of advice and best of luck on your journey,115
12,WesternTumbleweeds,"Okay, well I don't want to sound lacksadaisical, but it is your mother's choice.This being said, it's a fucking shame when someone avoids science based on superstitious beliefs and doesn't trust science. But I do have some insight -my Dad was the same, though he was a smart man, there was just this nagging cultural diaspora that came up at very bad times.There are two possibilities: First, your Mom is not being accurate in what her CMD is telling her. That it might be her own biases that are creating the situation. However, it could also be that she's being unduly influenced. And that influence might be because the doctor wants to offer her an alternative treatment for cash, make money off of her, regardless of a lack of scientific evidence.So my first question is: Have you gone with her to the CMD? Have you spoken to her? The next question is: Is the Chinese medicine doctor licensed in the state of California? Find out. If not, turn that doc into the California State Medical Board. You can also see if there are existing complaints lodged against them. If you observe that the doctor is talking smack, I would send that doctor a written warning -that her influence is beyond the bounds of scientific research, and that if your Mother's cancer is growing worse, she will be reported and sued. Sometimes just the threat of a suit is enough for the doctor to send your Mom away. I would have the pastor talk to her -but only if the pastor themself if pro-modern medicine. Find out first. I mean, if he's totally into dissing science, then he might be a nightmare. So suss him out. As far as where to go -it's completely dependent on her insurance. If she isn't set up online, then create an account with her insurance, and look for an oncologist covered under her plan.If she can go anywhere, you might look into university hospitals, who will also be involved in ongoing clinical trials.However, I have seen patients in the past who fit your Mom's exact profile -religious, more reliant on Eastern medicine, and saw Western medicine as 'bad' or 'painful.' I watched my own father use various heated beans for stuff -- oh man, do not get me started on his refusal to take medication for what eventually killed him. Or my Mom. And it was really bad, because at the time, I managed a surgery clinic. I remember one patient who bounced from surgeon to surgeon for many opinions about her breast cancer diagnosis -all opinions agreeing on the same treatment plan. We found out, because we were the 7th surgeon's office she'd gone to... I guess she was looking for divine salvation. We said the same thing, and also found out her family was in the dark about this. She disappeared -went the natural route. Came in again, 2 years later to another surgeon she had seen before, and it was too late for surgery.",2843
13,Misocainea822,"She’s making an important decision while lost in a cloud of ignorance and fear. She deserves to make an informed decision. You deserve that too, Perhaps talking to other cancer patients who conquered the same problem. Forums are available online. I endured a stage 3c cancer eight years ago. I was 65. I'm now leading a thankfully normal life. My story is not unusual.",378
14,whymedschool,Is she by any chance Asian and in California?,56
15,Doctorphate,"Her body her choice my friend. I’ve had cancer twice and both times I had people telling me what to do and all it ever did was make me dislike them. Support her and her decision and she will appreciate it. Fight her and you won’t be there to see her go, that’s the only guarantee in this situation.",315
16,dirkwoods,"Agree with those advocating for ""complementary medicine"" practitioner as a middle ground. I have had a good experience at UCSF. Not sure where you are in CA. If she elects to do Western approach a NCI center in CA would be my advice.",246
17,HailTheCrimsonKing,Unfortunately it is her choice to pursue treatment or not,67
18,Aware-Locksmith-7313,"Staging typically takes place AFTER surgery, not based on a mere test, which you don’t specify. As for “in her 60s” that could be anywhere from 60 to 69, so big difference. You are facing a tough challenge, yet could it be she was misdiagnosed by the quack?",267
