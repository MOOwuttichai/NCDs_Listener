Diligent-Activity-70	"I'm sure you don't want to hear this, but it is completely her choice. It's her disease in her body and she has the right to treat it or not. We see this all the time where the family disagrees and wants to force someone to do what they think is best. Sometimes the family wants alternative medicine; sometimes the family is opposed to alternative medicine or opposed to the individual declining any further treatments... Having cancer does not take away an individual's autonomy. It doesn't make us incapable of understanding the severity of our circumstances, nor does it prevent us f from making informed decisions. She doesn't have to get tests that she doesn't want. She doesn't have to make the same treatment choices that you THINK you would make if you had cancer (you don't know until you're in the position). She can choose to see her Chinese medical practitioner if that's what she is comfortable with."	944
FartnSpartn	"I can’t comprehend how difficult it is to undergo chemo, I would leave treatment entirely up to her. But I don’t think it is unreasonable to try to convince her of getting a biopsy especially because she was previously open to it (wasn’t able to find appointments at that time)."	288
danijay637	"The best way to understand her feelings is listen to her. Ask questions with an open mind . And learn to be okay if she says things you may not agree with. She is the patient and it’s her life. For instance, instead of saying something like “ you should go to the doctor.” Ask “would you be open to seeing what the doctor recommends?”"	351
sk7515	"I would ask her what her fears are. Talking to someone, listening to their feelings (and really listening, not being dismissive) might help them to look at pros and cons. But find out what she is afraid of. Is it pain? Is it losing hair from chemo? Is it fighting only to lose? But talk openly, and really listen to her opinion in a non judgmental way. Ultimately it is her decision because it’s her body."	415
Conflicted_Nebula	"Are there patient groups around? Or better, patient groups with a religious background? Listening to other’s experience might help"	140
PurpleFlame8	Your best bet would probably be to find a pro western medicine eastern medicine practitioner. One who will do acupuncture and suction cups if she wants but who will also encourage her to do conventional treatment or insist she also do conventional treatment.	268
I_ask_questions_thx	"I would suggest you sit down and tell her no one will force her to do anything but if she’s willing to tell you what she is worried about, what she’s heard and what she understands of the situation. Don’t assume anything and fully understand her mindset so you have a basis and context. Next, tell her no one is going to make her do anything she doesn’t want to but if she is religious then maybe prayer is answered in mysterious ways. What if you being a caring child is the universes way of sending help. At the very least ask her if you can talk to a specialist without committing to treatment to understand the situation and have them explain survival risk. If it really is stage 2c I think chemo/radiation is probably the treatment and or surgery depending on size and location. Though if she’s not willing to get treatment I can understand why she would want to avoid surgery and chemo/radiation. Those are things you can discuss with the doctor to find something that is less invasive. It really needs to be her own decision because if she’s pressured into it, you would need to deal with the regret of pressuring her into a treatment that made her suffer. If it really is stage 2c I personally think it’s worth a shot. Also! A biopsy is usually not as invasive as you think. It’s a needle biopsy no surgery. And if she has a genetic mutation test positive she can take a pill daily for a few years"	1485
Taytoh3ad	"Let her live and die by her own terms. You’ve said your piece to her, she has refused. She is still competent to decide her own healthcare. Support and love her, and don’t make this about yourself and your emotions, like you’re trying to do. It’s ok to let it go."	273
JRLDH	"She has stage 2 and is listening to a quack. I'm sorry, it's a bit callous to just say ""let her live and die by her own terms"". Yes, if she were stage 4 and hopeless but not stage 2 and hocus-pocus medical advice."	223
Electronic-Syrup-385	Having the pastor talk some sense into her sounds like your best bet. I’m going through chemo with stage 3b stomach cancer and while it’s not easy it is worth doing. She can do traditional medicine and chemotherapy	224
Meeelou	My dad has stage 3B lung cancer. There are people living years with immunotherapy and targeted therapies. I have spent so much time researching and learning and advocating. It’s overwhelming to say the least. I’m grateful I’m a nurse practitioner and have the ability to interpret data. Please feel free to message me if you have questions or just need to talk!	371
FartnSpartn	I will definitely shoot you a message! Thank you for the words of advice and best of luck on your journey	115
WesternTumbleweeds	"Okay, well I don't want to sound lacksadaisical, but it is your mother's choice.This being said, it's a fucking shame when someone avoids science based on superstitious beliefs and doesn't trust science. But I do have some insight -my Dad was the same, though he was a smart man, there was just this nagging cultural diaspora that came up at very bad times.There are two possibilities: First, your Mom is not being accurate in what her CMD is telling her. That it might be her own biases that are creating the situation. However, it could also be that she's being unduly influenced. And that influence might be because the doctor wants to offer her an alternative treatment for cash, make money off of her, regardless of a lack of scientific evidence.So my first question is: Have you gone with her to the CMD? Have you spoken to her? The next question is: Is the Chinese medicine doctor licensed in the state of California? Find out. If not, turn that doc into the California State Medical Board. You can also see if there are existing complaints lodged against them. If you observe that the doctor is talking smack, I would send that doctor a written warning -that her influence is beyond the bounds of scientific research, and that if your Mother's cancer is growing worse, she will be reported and sued. Sometimes just the threat of a suit is enough for the doctor to send your Mom away. I would have the pastor talk to her -but only if the pastor themself if pro-modern medicine. Find out first. I mean, if he's totally into dissing science, then he might be a nightmare. So suss him out. As far as where to go -it's completely dependent on her insurance. If she isn't set up online, then create an account with her insurance, and look for an oncologist covered under her plan.If she can go anywhere, you might look into university hospitals, who will also be involved in ongoing clinical trials.However, I have seen patients in the past who fit your Mom's exact profile -religious, more reliant on Eastern medicine, and saw Western medicine as 'bad' or 'painful.' I watched my own father use various heated beans for stuff -- oh man, do not get me started on his refusal to take medication for what eventually killed him. Or my Mom. And it was really bad, because at the time, I managed a surgery clinic. I remember one patient who bounced from surgeon to surgeon for many opinions about her breast cancer diagnosis -all opinions agreeing on the same treatment plan. We found out, because we were the 7th surgeon's office she'd gone to... I guess she was looking for divine salvation. We said the same thing, and also found out her family was in the dark about this. She disappeared -went the natural route. Came in again, 2 years later to another surgeon she had seen before, and it was too late for surgery."	2843
Misocainea822	"She’s making an important decision while lost in a cloud of ignorance and fear. She deserves to make an informed decision. You deserve that too, Perhaps talking to other cancer patients who conquered the same problem. Forums are available online. I endured a stage 3c cancer eight years ago. I was 65. I'm now leading a thankfully normal life. My story is not unusual."	378
whymedschool	Is she by any chance Asian and in California?	56
Doctorphate	"Her body her choice my friend. I’ve had cancer twice and both times I had people telling me what to do and all it ever did was make me dislike them. Support her and her decision and she will appreciate it. Fight her and you won’t be there to see her go, that’s the only guarantee in this situation."	315
dirkwoods	"Agree with those advocating for ""complementary medicine"" practitioner as a middle ground. I have had a good experience at UCSF. Not sure where you are in CA. If she elects to do Western approach a NCI center in CA would be my advice."	246
HailTheCrimsonKing	Unfortunately it is her choice to pursue treatment or not	67
Aware-Locksmith-7313	"Staging typically takes place AFTER surgery, not based on a mere test, which you don’t specify. As for “in her 60s” that could be anywhere from 60 to 69, so big difference. You are facing a tough challenge, yet could it be she was misdiagnosed by the quack?"	267
Informal-Cod6895	"Hi u/Top_Succotash9573, I am so very sorry your family is going through this. My mom was diagnosed with S4 lung cancer a few years ago and I was in a very similar place with it all. She is the most health-conscious person I know, never smoked, meditates daily, and is very in tune with her body - this took us all for a huge roller coaster ride. What advice I can offer is to be gentle with yourself (not ""strong"") during this time of grieving. Try taking the perspective of ""we are taking things one day at a time"" rather than trying to force acceptance of the situation. Acceptance will develop gradually in its own, subtle way. Do something for yourself each day, it is important to take care of your own health (slow walk around the park, cup of tea, resting in the sun). Reach out to your community (like you are doing now!) - it is shocking how many people have been touched by cancer and will show up to support you. The earliest days are the scariest because you feel in utter limbo waiting for the specific diagnosis and treatment plans. For us, this took around 6 months to get sorted. During this time, I just kept repeating to myself ""there is no better time or place in the world to have cancer."" The interventions have come SUCH a long way! We are over 4 years out from her initial diagnosis and she has had no new growth for the past 2 years. It's okay to not be okay, but have faith in knowing the only constant thing in this world is change <3"	1484
Top_Succotash9573	"Thank you for your kind words. As you said.. we're all taking it one day at a time. We are lucky to be very near a large cancer hospital in London and he is receiving treatment and amazing care from his team of drs and nurses. I'm inspired by them and their outlook on it all. Hopefull, but not out of the woods just yet. 4 & 2 is amazing! Still not ideal but something for you all to be happy and proud for. I'm cheering us all on, and thankful for all of the support. â¤ï¸ðŸ™"	497
Recording-Dismal	"Iâ€™m in exactly the same position with my mum. Also not religious. Itâ€™s horrible having all these feelings and emotions, while also trying to be strong for them. I canâ€™t really help just no you arenâ€™t alone going through this. My mum is my best friend and Iâ€™ll be lost without her."	290
ran44445	"Sending you and your dad warm thoughts. My mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung cancer in february. She had not smoked in 46 years and at age 85 was the picture of health. We were all shocked. It is an emotional rollercoaster with the first month being especially bad. My mom was very depressed. I had a panic attack with my heart rate skyrocketing to 167. Fast forward to now, mom is in a clinical trial and how interesting it was that once she started treatment her emotional state got much better as she is doing what she can to stabilize while it is not curable. Take care of yourself, and enjoy every minute you can with your dad. These are rough waters to navigate. The people in this forum are kind and very wise. I often get nuggets of something that helps me. One very wise person in this forum said â€œ they are living with cancer vs focusing on dying from cancer.â€ I think of those words daily. Hoping for good days ahead together for you both."	964
Top_Succotash9573	"Thank you.. my dad's 67 so while a bit younger still no less of a shock. While like your mother there is no chance of curing it, we are hopefull the treatment will have some positive effects. ðŸ™â¤ï¸"	219

Infamous-Crazy-4672	"Sorry to hear that; Ã  year ago I was also hit by Cancer with a stage 4 lung cancer. I made peace with myself and came to the conclusion that I had only two choices; get depressed and scared and accept my situation and die or gather all my might and energy and fight this. A year later after immunotherapy chemotherapy Ã  surgery and some rehab I am almost ready to go back to work. Was a hell of a ride but the key was to believe that I can beat Cancer with the help and support of modern science and all of the medical team involved. I see this as a second chance on life, but you have to fight for it. Get some support talk to people that have been through it you will see that it s doable. I wish you and your dad the best and for one I believe that with the right mind set he will make it. By the way I am 64 so imagine at 45 he is much stronger than I am to fight this. Good luck and keep the faith"	912
Top_Succotash9573	"Im 45, he's 67....thanks for your comment. ðŸ™"	54
Infinite_Purple1123	"Right now you have to take care of yourself. And enjoy whatever time you have with him. I lost my dad last year to aggressive lung cancer. He did smoke but he has quit 6 years before he got sick, and it just didn't matter. The one thing I wish more than anything is that more of the family had shared the caregiving with me so I could have been his daughter more and his caregiver less. As for what's next, I can't say anything definitively, but here's what I believe: The first law of thermodynamics is that energy can neither be created, nor can it be destroyed. The soul is often described as the spark. A spark is energy. The human soul is energy. When our loved ones die, it's not their soul dying. It's the vessel that carried that spark breaking down. So their energy WILL carry on. It will cycle again. Your loved one isn't ending. The spark that made them them is just finding a new purpose. Because that energy can never destroyed. The spark that makes your dad who he is will make its way back into the world. What form it takes is unknown. But his energy is going to get to see the world in a way the living can only dream. Of. Not the end of the adventure. Just the next leg of the journey. I dunno if that helps, but it's given me solace in losing both my mom and dad. The hardest part of accepting that is knowing that the next page if our loved one's story doesn't include us."	1465
Sandz86_	"I completely understand what youâ€™re feeling. My mum was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer last year; she turns 67 this year. I mourn our old life more than anything which is natural I suppose. My mum was on targeted chemotherapy treatment but sheâ€™s had a new growth in her lower back which means a change of treatment to two varieties of chemo. I was hopefully she would last at least a couple of years on the targeted treatment before progression but whatâ€™s meant to be will be. The most frustrating part of this process is not knowing what is going to happen next. I keep telling myself I should be grateful sheâ€™s still here, seeing as when she was diagnosed I didnâ€™t think sheâ€™d make it to the summer of last year let alone where we are. As for what happens after this existence; I canâ€™t say I have a definitive belief on that but what I can say is my mum and I have conversations about death, not in a morbid way but just to talk about it. She always says if itâ€™s her time to go all she asks is that she doesnâ€™t suffer. As another commenter has written; energy cannot be destroyed, a part of our loved ones stays alive within us, that little piece of them and the love we felt for them is what we carry forward with us when theyâ€™re gone. Itâ€™s hard but all I can say to you is just try and take each day at a time, the more you mentally spiral the less youâ€™ll be able to be fully present which is what counts the most right now x"	1443
Patchouli061017	Iâ€™m so sorry this is so hard. Please consider joining this Facebook group itâ€™s very supportive for young lung cancer patients https://www.facebook.com/share/USc4CxnXmHLnB2we/?mibextid=K35XfP Also check out YLCI.org	229
missmypets	"No one is promised a tomorrow. London, England or London, Ontario, Canada? If you're in the UK you will find support at a Maggie's Centre.

AngelsMessenger	"Hi there, I am sorry you are losing your loved one. It sucks as I lost my sister in 2022 to breast cancer. I am a religious person and a Christian. Itâ€™s okay if some people donâ€™t agree with me, but what comforted me when my sister passed away was knowing she was going into a deep â€œsleep.â€ The Bible calls death a sleep. On that day their thoughts perish, and their breath â€œspiritâ€ goes back to the life-giver God, and his body returns to the dust of the ground. I believe my sister is sleeping and awaiting the resurrection. Genesis 3:19. So this comforts me in that she is not seeing all the pain going on in our world, but sleeping in her grave. I am not sure if I have helped, but I hope you will find peace in your loved ones' passing. Again, I am deeply sorry. â¤ï¸ðŸŒº"	780
Top_Succotash9573	Hes still alive...and thanks. Sending religious quotes to a person who isnt religious is really not the way.	125
Top_Succotash9573	Wow.. thank you so much for makibg time to write this lovely comment!	79
Party_Author_9337	"Young lung cancer initiative is on Instagram, TikTok and I believe Facebook. A lot of the statistics you can Google are geared toward older adults with lung cancer. So donâ€™t or stop doing that. She will probably have genetic testing to determine her best treatment course. It took about a month for my results to come back. I had no targetable mutations. I was stage two so one lobe was removed. I did four rounds of chemo and am doing immunotherapy for a year I have seen Women in their thirties who had stage four lung cancer show no evidence of disease after treatment. So there is hope"	645
starkiller10707	So whatâ€™s state 3 like in the running of how serious it is for her? Sheâ€™s like 22 btw	95
Pretty-Narwhal-3313	How are you doing with immunotherapy? Any problems with autoimmune attacks?	85
mistermoondog	Hi Starâ€”Sorry the two of you are stuck with thisâ€”cancer has been a fact of life in my family for 50 years. You need tons of patience about this because it takes considerable time for the medical team to understand what they are up against and how your Gfâ€™s biology responds to initial treatments. There are support groups in your area that can be of a great benefit to preserving your happiness.	419
starkiller10707	Support groups?	25
HellaYeah650	"I'm so sorry first, 22 is super young but we can help. Please call the GO2 For Lung Cancer we have The Epidemiology of Young Lung Cancer (EoYLC) study for those under the age of 50. You may call our helpline 1-800-298-2436, we can help with anything lung cancer. https://go2.org/research/our-research-studies/epidemiology-of-young-lung-cancer/"	357
Patchouli061017	Hi Young lung cancer Facebook group has many patients and loved ones diagnosed with lung cancer under 50 . It is very helpful. Please make sure that they are testing your girlfriend for biomarkers	207
jj0220220	Hi! Fellow lung cancer fighter here. I was diagnosed at 37-stage four. Sorry you guys have to navigate this at such a young age. Iâ€™ve been on my first line treatment for over 2.5 years. Please make sure she gets biomarker testing. It will tell her what type of treatment works best for her. There are a lot more treatments coming out for lung cancer and a lot more options than there use to be a few years ago.	421
onions-make-me-cry	"I'm gonna hope she has Lung Carcinoid, low grade. That would be a ""good"" type (and what I had). Lung cancer as a category is too variable for us to say anything. The good news is she's very young so her body is likely in a strong position to fight this."	277
drainbance	I think writing them letters that they can read in the future would be highly appreciated by them	107
jackhandy2B	"Came here to say exactly this. Meanwhile, just love them now and answer questions honestly. Best you can do, really."	126
Low-Future9354	This does sounds like a great idea. I feel like I'd be a mess if I tried to say a real goodbye in person!	115
GeneralTonight2401	Even a video to add with it would be nice	51
RenzelW	My wife is currently dying of brain cancer with no window of time remaining outside of â€œprobably not gonna see 2025.â€ Sheâ€™s elected to record videos for the little ones in the family to explain who she was and what her life was like and her illness and what happened. Sheâ€™s left strict instructions not to give it to them until theyâ€™re old enough to understand and she said that the last time she says goodbye sheâ€™s just going to tell them sheâ€™ll see them later. (Weâ€™re religious so â€œsee you laterâ€ to her is a sneaky way of saying she can see them in heaven)	583
Low-Future9354	Videos are honestly a great idea. I didn't even think of videos. They could rewatch it as often as they wanted. Thanks so much for this idea. Thoughts are with you and your wife also ðŸ’š	194
zaratheclown	"this is absolutely beautiful! your wife sounds like a gem of a person iâ€™ve heard of someone who did this with their nieces but in addition, they gave some jewellery so that they can wear it when they â€˜see them laterâ€™"	233
PetalumaDr	"Maybe an appropriate modification of Ira Byockâ€™s â€œ5 thingsâ€ (which started as 4). I l love you, thank you for being part of my life, I forgive you for anything you may regret, please forgive me for anything I did which may have hurt you, I believe in you. Again it depends on the relationship and age but I find those 5 things to be an awesome start."	360
CarinaConstellation	Maybe give them a gift of a framed photo of you and them and a handwritten note so they can keep it. That's what my step mom did when she died.	153
cornteahasnoname	"My first niece was born a month ago. I donâ€™t know for sure how long I have left, but she will likely not remember me. Iâ€™ve thought a lot about how to tell her how much I love her and what she means to me, even though sheâ€™ll never know me. My brother and SIL have been building her a little library that they hope to add to over the years, so Iâ€™ve been buying some of my favorite books and writing notes to her on the inside cover. Sometimes they are super heartfelt and serious, and sometimes they are silly and fun. Sometimes they are about how that book made me feel when I read it, and asking her what she thinks about it. I know itâ€™s probably harder for you to say goodbye to older children who already know you, but maybe a little something that means a lot to you (like books do to me) with a handwritten note that they can always look back on would be nice. I wish you peace and comfort in your days ahead â¤ï¸"	925
stnrgrl10	"I don't have any advice, but I'm praying for you"	58
tamaith	"Cards and letters is a great idea. Another idea is recording videos, putting them on youtube in addition to keeping a hard copy to give the parents. If you don't know what to say read a book (for bedtime) or something with a personal message of what you want to say.An inexpensive tablet would be perfect to record and store the videos, upload them to keep them safe in the future."	391
Basic_Government_730	"I was around that age when my sister passed from leukemia and we didnâ€™t really have proper goodbyes but she left a voicemail of her singing me happy birthday (a few days before she died) and I listened to it all the time growing up. It got deleted when I moved out and it is gutting me even typing about it now. I was a weird kid so once I knew what she had I wanted to know everything I could about it, so I knew sheâ€™d be dying. I found having clear and objective information about the illness really helped me but that could just be the autism lol."	560
fox-lover	Make them videos so they can hear your voice.	55
PyewacketPonsonby	I have stage 4 cancer that is technically incurable and were I in this situation I wouldn't necessarily bring up the topic and I would leave it to the parents to deal with it after I am gone. However if they asked me about it I would give a pleasant variation of the truth - something that a child or young person could easily process or digest. Something hopeful and loving.	392
kiwi1327	I donâ€™t have advice but just wanted to say that Iâ€™m so very sorry that you have to even ask this question and that youâ€™re going through this.	151
erinmarie777	"I think itâ€™s important to be honest with them. We need to do more in this culture to make dying and death a more normal part of living and a more normal part of our conversations. But maybe also explain that itâ€™s rare for someone to die young, explaining most people are old when they die, so they will probably live until they are very old. I think I would want to give them a little stuffed animal to keep, and make them a video or write a letter for when they are older."	484
Plastic_Leg_3812	I agree with writing them a little message along with any photos you may have of yourself with them. They will cherish it. I mostly just wanted to say you sound like a wonderful person for caring so much about their feelings. Iâ€™m so sorry you are going through this.	276
HistoricalFishing2	"Video cards , letters, maybe even a little teddy bear from build a bear and record a message for them to play back whenever theyâ€™d like? My thoughts are with you! ðŸ™ðŸ¼"	175
