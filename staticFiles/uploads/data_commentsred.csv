dirkwoods,Wow. Sorry to hear about your bad news. I am a retired physician. I do not know the details of your case but I suspect that there was some miscommunication of some kind. Do not accept the nurse's assessment of your situation as the final word. If you have MyChart I would reach out to the Oncologist and ask about this in terms of possible miscommunication or possibly being confused about what the nurse said. You should also be given the chance to speak with the Radiation Oncologist as the expert on Friday at your appointment. I would place far more faith in what the Radiation Oncologist says. I had spinal lesions causing sciatica and had the start of motor weakness. I received radiation to the spine which reversed the pain and my motor strength has returned to normal. It seems to me if you have been told you might be paralyzed by this lesion that someone should have done a motor exam on you (formally tested your strength right now). As you are reaching out to the Oncologist and your PCP you might ask if anyone is concerned enough that you should have a motor exam or be placed on steroids awaiting the radiation (if both haven't already been done). In my case I was placed on high dose steroids awaiting the first radiation treatment. I suspect they might do the same for you. Good luck. This is part of what makes cancer so fun. Even as a physician I find the communication issues maddening.,1456
Aware-Locksmith-7313,Dirkwoods … Your observations are quite informative and make a great deal of sense. Best to you. … Maddening is the key word for OP’s situation with a nurse (an NP in action?) blathering about paralysis based only on on a scan.,237
puffedovenpancake,I just wanted to pop in and send some calming and healthy vibes. This is a big shock. I’m so sorry. I’m stage iv lung and it’s been a roller coaster. Do you have a palliative care doctor? Mine has been amazing helping me sort through medications and symptoms and feelings etc.,286
gemurmel,"I'm so sorry to hear this. For me, it was the other way round. CC spread to my spine and then to my lungs. But my spine is fine now. I get chemo+immunotherapy for my lungs. Have you talked to a neurosurgeon yet? They basically removed my T1 vertebrae, put some titanium plate in, then did 22 rounds of radiation and after that it was gone from my spine and still is. Don't listen to what an oncology nurse tells you, speak to the specialists whos job it is to treat cancer to the spine. Good luck!",521
beeboobum,"Stage 4 ovarian here. Please find a palliative care doctor asap- it was suggested to me from a fellow cancer survivor and I’m so glad I did. Once cancer has metastasized, it is typically a rollercoaster. In and out of remission. I’m currently in remission but I understand cancer is something i will be living with forever. Don’t be scared. You are alive and not paralyzed today and may never be paralyzed with prompt treatment. You can do this.",455
PenExactly,Inappropriate for a nurse to tell you that. Don’t panic. Talk to your oncologist. And report the nurse for giving such a dire prognosis.,148
Aware-Locksmith-7313,"Regret you’ve had such spread, and am wondering why concerning news like that is being delivered via phone by a nurse and not by your oncologist? Unacceptable.",170
Stickyduck468,Well that is a real kick in the teeth. So sorry for this difficult time.,82
Wyde1340,"I'm sorry to hear this, but here's some hope: I had cancer in many bones, but had radiation on the worse of them: hips, pelvis and femurs (I ended up breaking one femur in the middle of radiation, but the rest of the bone mets disappeared. Have hope!",261
BitsiBones,"I think I should clarify, in the UK cancer patients have a CNS (clinical nurse specialist) who is your personal oncology specialist nurse, she's not just a regular nurse. They're very specialised in your cancer and you're on a one-to-one basis with them they way you don't really get with your oncologist. Tbh I wouldn't have expected to get that news from anyone else, she's kind of your oncologist 2.0 so to speak.",426
skelterjohn,"That's really rough, sorry to hear about that outcome.",64
assisianinmomjeans,I have breast cancer metastasis to the spine. It’s been 9 years and I’m NED. Spinal mets are not always a paralyzer. I don’t know many people who have become paralyzed for spine mets.,193
Aware-Locksmith-7313,Yeah but OP’s nursey poo apparently thinks she knows all about how to read a scan and deliver dire news over the phone.,129
luckysevensampson,"I’m so sorry that you have to go through this. What I suspect the nurse said was “single fraction” rather than “ single section”. Each radiation dose is called a fraction, and they’re usually spaced apart in time so that the healthy cells have time to recover but the cancer cells don’t. Definitely see a radiation oncologist, and they can explain why it’s a single fraction. Best of luck with your treatment.",419
3DLeeLee,Get that second opinion baby Don't listen to that nurse I have stage 4: cervical cancer and I'm doing physical therapy because my Tivdak treatment was too strong and weakened my legs and had me walking like Daffy Duck due to neuropathy of my toes I know mine is a different situation and I'm terrified of everything cancerous as well but you got this I'm seeing a therapist journaling and called a cancer support group Friend For Life to talk about my cancer My friends and family isn't any help in this dept You will be surprised at who have gone through what and some of the same things as well and can give you great advice about different organizations that can help you I've heard of the operation on the spine as well DONT NOBODY WANT TO BE PARALYZED If you're able go ahead and start doing little exercises around your house or at the gym or get you some physical therapy to kick cancers ***You have to get in front of it If you're religious get those prayers going but that's not for everyone I feel what you are going through and rjust yesterday I felt bat shit crazy Im mean as hell Can't gain my weight back I have back pain The pharmacy plays with my meds but i still struggle to make it through Its a tough lonely horrible road I lost my father to prostate cancer 2 yrs ago That man was my superhero Oooooowwwee me and cancer go way back I AM FIGHTING AND I WANT YOU TO FIGHT YOU GOT THIS ♥️,1416
FrogAnToad,I had cancer throughout skeleton including inside cervical vertebrae. Two years later im still doing fine. Dont trust yr nurse. Even if it were true the way she told you is inexcusable.,195
pthrizzle,I’m so sorry. Sending prayers up and hopeful thoughts your way.,73
ReferenceSufficient,"In US, Nurses aren't suppose to give you test results, diagnosis, It's the Doctor that will inform you. Call the doctor and tell them what nurse told you.What country do you live in?",194
mmmonicapb,Im so sorry you received this tough news today. Go look for a second and a third opinion if necessary. So many of us internet strangers root for you. Feel free to DM if you need to talk.,196
This-Army6223,Okay first your nurse never should have said that. My cousin has lung cancer that traveled to her spine and fractured vertebrae. She was able to have radiation and surgery to stabilize the area and she is NOT paralyzed . Those lesions are now stable. There is no way for someone to know what she told you for sure. I'm sorry you're on this path. I am dealing with bone mets as well .,398
No-Count-2035,"Hi OP Im from sweden and here we also have our own specialist nurse that we talk to frequently. But I have to point out that sometimes my nurse could say things that turned out differently so I think the best thing is always to talk to your oncologist. I think its very easy for miscommunication and ultimatley, our nurses arent the experts on our cancer. They’re knowledgeable and have experience sure, but that doesnt make them experts like the oncologists. Also, I’ve had cancer in my spine, which even caused a fracture and compression (basically the entire vertebra is ruined and my spine is instable). But nobody said anything about getting paralyzed. Sounds so strange your nurse would just call you and tell you over the phone. Also, I believe surgery usually is an option for spine mets, especially to prevent paralysis. I hope you get more clear answers soon!",894
merce007,"I'm in a similar situation, I had great success with my hysterectomy in the middle of April, they got all of the cancer in the pelvis and abdomen and the lesions on my liver were so small they couldn't find them to ablate them. I had a catscan at the end of last month that indicated new liver and lung mets, and at my next follow up my Oncologist suggested she call an ambulance and get me to the hospital because I was having severe pain in my back, abdomen, pelvis and groin. I declined and drove to the hospital because it's literally right behind her office. I had a catscan guided biopsy for my abdomen where they found a 10cm tumor that was entirely new. When the MRI came back on my spine it showed a 3cm tumor with extensions into the soft tissue around L2. They contacted radiology and scheduled me for 5 treatments that ended on Thursday. The pain is a little better (being on the radiation table was the worst). And I'm told the tumor is dying. So the 10cm tumor in my abdomen was impinging upon my ureters coming from both kidneys, and yesterday they put Stents in to open them up. My back pain has improved. My advice would be to get a second opinion and if you're in the NE/SE Jersey/NY region reach out and I'll get you the info for my care team if you're interested.",1335
Party_Author_9337,"Young lung cancer initiative is on Instagram, TikTok and I believe Facebook. A lot of the statistics you can Google are geared toward older adults with lung cancer. So don’t or stop doing that. She will probably have genetic testing to determine her best treatment course. It took about a month for my results to come back. I had no targetable mutations. I was stage two so one lobe was removed. I did four rounds of chemo and am doing immunotherapy for a year I have seen Women in their thirties who had stage four lung cancer show no evidence of disease after treatment. So there is hope",645
starkiller10707,So what’s state 3 like in the running of how serious it is for her? She’s like 22 btw,95
Pretty-Narwhal-3313,How are you doing with immunotherapy? Any problems with autoimmune attacks?,85
mistermoondog,Hi Star—Sorry the two of you are stuck with this—cancer has been a fact of life in my family for 50 years. You need tons of patience about this because it takes considerable time for the medical team to understand what they are up against and how your Gf’s biology responds to initial treatments. There are support groups in your area that can be of a great benefit to preserving your happiness.,419
starkiller10707,Support groups?,25
HellaYeah650,"I'm so sorry first, 22 is super young but we can help. Please call the GO2 For Lung Cancer we have The Epidemiology of Young Lung Cancer (EoYLC) study for those under the age of 50.

Patchouli061017,Hi Young lung cancer Facebook group has many patients and loved ones diagnosed with lung cancer under 50 . It is very helpful. Please make sure that they are testing your girlfriend for biomarkers,207
jj0220220,Hi! Fellow lung cancer fighter here. I was diagnosed at 37-stage four. Sorry you guys have to navigate this at such a young age. I’ve been on my first line treatment for over 2.5 years. Please make sure she gets biomarker testing. It will tell her what type of treatment works best for her. There are a lot more treatments coming out for lung cancer and a lot more options than there use to be a few years ago.,421
onions-make-me-cry,"I'm gonna hope she has Lung Carcinoid, low grade. That would be a ""good"" type (and what I had). Lung cancer as a category is too variable for us to say anything. The good news is she's very young so her body is likely in a strong position to fight this.",277
Informal-Cod6895,"Hi u/Top_Succotash9573, I am so very sorry your family is going through this. My mom was diagnosed with S4 lung cancer a few years ago and I was in a very similar place with it all. She is the most health-conscious person I know, never smoked, meditates daily, and is very in tune with her body - this took us all for a huge roller coaster ride. What advice I can offer is to be gentle with yourself (not ""strong"") during this time of grieving. Try taking the perspective of ""we are taking things one day at a time"" rather than trying to force acceptance of the situation. Acceptance will develop gradually in its own, subtle way. Do something for yourself each day, it is important to take care of your own health (slow walk around the park, cup of tea, resting in the sun). Reach out to your community (like you are doing now!) - it is shocking how many people have been touched by cancer and will show up to support you. The earliest days are the scariest because you feel in utter limbo waiting for the specific diagnosis and treatment plans. For us, this took around 6 months to get sorted. During this time, I just kept repeating to myself ""there is no better time or place in the world to have cancer."" The interventions have come SUCH a long way! We are over 4 years out from her initial diagnosis and she has had no new growth for the past 2 years. It's okay to not be okay, but have faith in knowing the only constant thing in this world is change <3",1484
Top_Succotash9573,"Thank you for your kind words. As you said.. we're all taking it one day at a time. We are lucky to be very near a large cancer hospital in London and he is receiving treatment and amazing care from his team of drs and nurses. I'm inspired by them and their outlook on it all. Hopefull, but not out of the woods just yet. 4 & 2 is amazing! Still not ideal but something for you all to be happy and proud for. I'm cheering us all on, and thankful for all of the support. ❤️🙏",497
Recording-Dismal,"I’m in exactly the same position with my mum. Also not religious. It’s horrible having all these feelings and emotions, while also trying to be strong for them.

ran44445,"Sending you and your dad warm thoughts. My mom was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung cancer in february. She had not smoked in 46 years and at age 85 was the picture of health. We were all shocked. It is an emotional rollercoaster with the first month being especially bad. My mom was very depressed. I had a panic attack with my heart rate skyrocketing to 167. Fast forward to now, mom is in a clinical trial and how interesting it was that once she started treatment her emotional state got much better as she is doing what she can to stabilize while it is not curable. Take care of yourself, and enjoy every minute you can with your dad. These are rough waters to navigate. The people in this forum are kind and very wise. I often get nuggets of something that helps me. One very wise person in this forum said “ they are living with cancer vs focusing on dying from cancer.” I think of those words daily. Hoping for good days ahead together for you both.",964
Top_Succotash9573,"Thank you.. my dad's 67 so while a bit younger still no less of a shock. While like your mother there is no chance of curing it, we are hopefull the treatment will have some positive effects. 🙏❤️",219

Infamous-Crazy-4672,"Sorry to hear that; à year ago I was also hit by Cancer with a stage 4 lung cancer. I made peace with myself and came to the conclusion that I had only two choices; get depressed and scared and accept my situation and die or gather all my might and energy and fight this. A year later after immunotherapy chemotherapy à surgery and some rehab I am almost ready to go back to work. Was a hell of a ride but the key was to believe that I can beat Cancer with the help and support of modern science and all of the medical team involved. I see this as a second chance on life, but you have to fight for it. Get some support talk to people that have been through it you will see that it s doable. I wish you and your dad the best and for one I believe that with the right mind set he will make it. By the way I am 64 so imagine at 45 he is much stronger than I am to fight this. Good luck and keep the faith",912

Infinite_Purple1123,"Right now you have to take care of yourself. And enjoy whatever time you have with him. I lost my dad last year to aggressive lung cancer. He did smoke but he has quit 6 years before he got sick, and it just didn't matter. The one thing I wish more than anything is that more of the family had shared the caregiving with me so I could have been his daughter more and his caregiver less. As for what's next, I can't say anything definitively, but here's what I believe: The first law of thermodynamics is that energy can neither be created, nor can it be destroyed. The soul is often described as the spark. A spark is energy. The human soul is energy. When our loved ones die, it's not their soul dying. It's the vessel that carried that spark breaking down. So their energy WILL carry on. It will cycle again. Your loved one isn't ending. The spark that made them them is just finding a new purpose. Because that energy can never destroyed. The spark that makes your dad who he is will make its way back into the world. What form it takes is unknown. But his energy is going to get to see the world in a way the living can only dream. Of. Not the end of the adventure. Just the next leg of the journey. I dunno if that helps, but it's given me solace in losing both my mom and dad. The hardest part of accepting that is knowing that the next page if our loved one's story doesn't include us.",1465
Sandz86_,"I completely understand what you’re feeling. My mum was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer last year; she turns 67 this year. I mourn our old life more than anything which is natural I suppose. My mum was on targeted chemotherapy treatment but she’s had a new growth in her lower back which means a change of treatment to two varieties of chemo. I was hopefully she would last at least a couple of years on the targeted treatment before progression but what’s meant to be will be. The most frustrating part of this process is not knowing what is going to happen next. I keep telling myself I should be grateful she’s still here, seeing as when she was diagnosed I didn’t think she’d make it to the summer of last year let alone where we are. As for what happens after this existence; I can’t say I have a definitive belief on that but what I can say is my mum and I have conversations about death, not in a morbid way but just to talk about it. She always says if it’s her time to go all she asks is that she doesn’t suffer. As another commenter has written; energy cannot be destroyed, a part of our loved ones stays alive within us, that little piece of them and the love we felt for them is what we carry forward with us when they’re gone. It’s hard but all I can say to you is just try and take each day at a time, the more you mentally spiral the less you’ll be able to be fully present which is what counts the most right now x",1443

AngelsMessenger,"Hi there, I am sorry you are losing your loved one. It sucks as I lost my sister in 2022 to breast cancer. I am a religious person and a Christian. It’s okay if some people don’t agree with me, but what comforted me when my sister passed away was knowing she was going into a deep “sleep.” The Bible calls death a sleep. On that day their thoughts perish, and their breath “spirit” goes back to the life-giver God, and his body returns to the dust of the ground. I believe my sister is sleeping and awaiting the resurrection. Genesis 3:19. So this comforts me in that she is not seeing all the pain going on in our world, but sleeping in her grave. I am not sure if I have helped, but I hope you will find peace in your loved ones' passing. Again, I am deeply sorry. ❤️🌺",780

RenzelW,My wife is currently dying of brain cancer with no window of time remaining outside of “probably not gonna see 2025.” She’s elected to record videos for the little ones in the family to explain who she was and what her life was like and her illness and what happened. She’s left strict instructions not to give it to them until they’re old enough to understand and she said that the last time she says goodbye she’s just going to tell them she’ll see them later. (We’re religious so “see you later” to her is a sneaky way of saying she can see them in heaven),583

cornteahasnoname,"My first niece was born a month ago. I don’t know for sure how long I have left, but she will likely not remember me. I’ve thought a lot about how to tell her how much I love her and what she means to me, even though she’ll never know me. My brother and SIL have been building her a little library that they hope to add to over the years, so I’ve been buying some of my favorite books and writing notes to her on the inside cover. Sometimes they are super heartfelt and serious, and sometimes they are silly and fun. Sometimes they are about how that book made me feel when I read it, and asking her what she thinks about it. I know it’s probably harder for you to say goodbye to older children who already know you, but maybe a little something that means a lot to you (like books do to me) with a handwritten note that they can always look back on would be nice.
