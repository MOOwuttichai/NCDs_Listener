AngelsMessenger,"Hi there, I am sorry you are losing your loved one. It sucks as I lost my sister in 2022 to breast cancer. I am a religious person and a Christian. It’s okay if some people don’t agree with me, but what comforted me when my sister passed away was knowing she was going into a deep “sleep.” The Bible calls death a sleep. On that day their thoughts perish, and their breath “spirit” goes back to the life-giver God, and his body returns to the dust of the ground. I believe my sister is sleeping and awaiting the resurrection. Genesis 3:19. So this comforts me in that she is not seeing all the pain going on in our world, but sleeping in her grave. I am not sure if I have helped, but I hope you will find peace in your loved ones' passing. Again, I am deeply sorry. ❤️🌺",780,"['start', 'hi', 'i', 'sorry', 'losing', 'loved', 'one', 'it', 'sucks', 'i', 'lost', 'sister', '2022', 'breast', 'cancer', 'i', 'religious', 'person', 'christian', 'it', '’', 'okay', 'people', '’', 'agree', 'comforted', 'sister', 'passed', 'away', 'knowing', 'going', 'deep', '“', 'sleep', '”', 'the', 'bible', 'calls', 'death', 'sleep', 'on', 'day', 'thoughts', 'perish', 'breath', '“', 'spirit', '”', 'goes', 'back', 'lifegiver', 'god', 'body', 'returns', 'dust', 'ground', 'i', 'believe', 'sister', 'sleeping', 'awaiting', 'resurrection', 'genesis', '319', 'so', 'comforts', 'seeing', 'pain', 'going', 'world', 'sleeping', 'grave', 'i', 'sure', 'i', 'helped', 'i', 'hope', 'find', 'peace', 'loved', 'ones', 'passing', 'again', 'i', 'deeply', 'sorry', '❤️🌺', 'end']",breast cancer,Both genders are told.,Gender not specified,Tell about your own experiences,maybe_useful,['pain'],0,1

Infamous-Crazy-4672,"Sorry to hear that; à year ago I was also hit by Cancer with a stage 4 lung cancer. I made peace with myself and came to the conclusion that I had only two choices; get depressed and scared and accept my situation and die or gather all my might and energy and fight this. A year later after immunotherapy chemotherapy à surgery and some rehab I am almost ready to go back to work. Was a hell of a ride but the key was to believe that I can beat Cancer with the help and support of modern science and all of the medical team involved. I see this as a second chance on life, but you have to fight for it. Get some support talk to people that have been through it you will see that it s doable. I wish you and your dad the best and for one I believe that with the right mind set he will make it. By the way I am 64 so imagine at 45 he is much stronger than I am to fight this.

Infinite_Purple1123,"Right now you have to take care of yourself. And enjoy whatever time you have with him. I lost my dad last year to aggressive lung cancer. He did smoke but he has quit 6 years before he got sick, and it just didn't matter. The one thing I wish more than anything is that more of the family had shared the caregiving with me so I could have been his daughter more and his caregiver less. As for what's next, I can't say anything definitively, but here's what I believe: The first law of thermodynamics is that energy can neither be created, nor can it be destroyed. The soul is often described as the spark. A spark is energy. The human soul is energy. When our loved ones die, it's not their soul dying. It's the vessel that carried that spark breaking down. So their energy WILL carry on. It will cycle again. Your loved one isn't ending. The spark that made them them is just finding a new purpose. Because that energy can never destroyed. The spark that makes your dad who he is will make its way back into the world. What form it takes is unknown. But his energy is going to get to see the world in a way the living can only dream. Of. Not the end of the adventure. Just the next leg of the journey. I dunno if that helps, but it's given me solace in losing both my mom and dad. The hardest part of accepting that is knowing that the next page if our loved one's story doesn't include us.",1465,"['start', 'right', 'take', 'care', 'and', 'enjoy', 'whatever', 'time', 'i', 'lost', 'dad', 'last', 'year', 'aggressive', 'lung', 'cancer', 'he', 'smoke', 'quit', '6', 'years', 'got', 'sick', 'didnt', 'matter', 'the', 'one', 'thing', 'i', 'wish', 'anything', 'family', 'shared', 'caregiving', 'i', 'could', 'daughter', 'caregiver', 'less', 'as', 'whats', 'next', 'i', 'cant', 'say', 'anything', 'definitively', 'heres', 'i', 'believe', 'the', 'first', 'law', 'thermodynamics', 'energy', 'neither', 'created', 'destroyed', 'the', 'soul', 'often', 'described', 'spark', 'a', 'spark', 'energy', 'the', 'human', 'soul', 'energy', 'when', 'loved', 'ones', 'die', 'soul', 'dying', 'its', 'vessel', 'carried', 'spark', 'breaking', 'so', 'energy', 'will', 'carry', 'it', 'cycle', 'your', 'loved', 'one', 'isnt', 'ending', 'the', 'spark', 'made', 'finding', 'new', 'purpose', 'because', 'energy', 'never', 'destroyed', 'the', 'spark', 'makes', 'dad', 'make', 'way', 'back', 'world', 'what', 'form', 'takes', 'unknown', 'but', 'energy', 'going', 'get', 'see', 'world', 'way', 'living', 'dream', 'of', 'not', 'end', 'adventure', 'just', 'next', 'leg', 'journey', 'i', 'dunno', 'helps', 'given', 'solace', 'losing', 'mom', 'dad', 'the', 'hardest', 'part', 'accepting', 'knowing', 'next', 'page', 'loved', 'ones', 'story', 'doesnt', 'include', 'us', 'end']",lung cancer,Both genders are told.,Gender not specified,Tell about your own experiences,maybe_useful,['No symptoms identified'],1,0
Informal-Cod6895,"Hi u/Top_Succotash9573, I am so very sorry your family is going through this. My mom was diagnosed with S4 lung cancer a few years ago and I was in a very similar place with it all. She is the most health-conscious person I know, never smoked, meditates daily, and is very in tune with her body - this took us all for a huge roller coaster ride. What advice I can offer is to be gentle with yourself (not ""strong"") during this time of grieving. Try taking the perspective of ""we are taking things one day at a time"" rather than trying to force acceptance of the situation. Acceptance will develop gradually in its own, subtle way. Do something for yourself each day, it is important to take care of your own health (slow walk around the park, cup of tea, resting in the sun). Reach out to your community (like you are doing now!) - it is shocking how many people have been touched by cancer and will show up to support you. The earliest days are the scariest because you feel in utter limbo waiting for the specific diagnosis and treatment plans. For us, this took around 6 months to get sorted. During this time, I just kept repeating to myself ""there is no better time or place in the world to have cancer."" The interventions have come SUCH a long way! We are over 4 years out from her initial diagnosis and she has had no new growth for the past 2 years. It's okay to not be okay, but have faith in knowing the only constant thing in this world is change <3",1484,"['start', 'hi', 'utopsuccotash9573', 'i', 'sorry', 'family', 'going', 'my', 'mom', 'diagnosed', 's4', 'lung', 'cancer', 'years', 'ago', 'i', 'similar', 'place', 'she', 'healthconscious', 'person', 'i', 'know', 'never', 'smoked', 'meditates', 'daily', 'tune', 'body', 'took', 'us', 'huge', 'roller', 'coaster', 'ride', 'what', 'advice', 'i', 'offer', 'gentle', 'strong', 'time', 'grieving', 'try', 'taking', 'perspective', 'taking', 'things', 'one', 'day', 'time', 'rather', 'trying', 'force', 'acceptance', 'situation', 'acceptance', 'develop', 'gradually', 'subtle', 'way', 'do', 'something', 'day', 'important', 'take', 'care', 'health', 'slow', 'walk', 'around', 'park', 'cup', 'tea', 'resting', 'sun', 'reach', 'community', 'like', 'shocking', 'many', 'people', 'touched', 'cancer', 'show', 'support', 'the', 'earliest', 'days', 'scariest', 'feel', 'utter', 'limbo', 'waiting', 'specific', 'diagnosis', 'treatment', 'plans', 'for', 'us', 'took', 'around', '6', 'months', 'get', 'sorted', 'during', 'time', 'i', 'kept', 'repeating', 'better', 'time', 'place', 'world', 'cancer', 'the', 'interventions', 'come', 'such', 'long', 'way', 'we', '4', 'years', 'initial', 'diagnosis', 'new', 'growth', 'past', '2', 'years', 'its', 'okay', 'okay', 'faith', 'knowing', 'constant', 'thing', 'world', 'change', '3', 'end']",lung cancer,Both genders are told.,Gender not specified,Tell about your own experiences,maybe_useful,['No symptoms identified'],1,0

RenzelW,My wife is currently dying of brain cancer with no window of time remaining outside of “probably not gonna see 2025.” She’s elected to record videos for the little ones in the family to explain who she was and what her life was like and her illness and what happened. She’s left strict instructions not to give it to them until they’re old enough to understand and she said that the last time she says goodbye she’s just going to tell them she’ll see them later.

Sandz86_,"I completely understand what you’re feeling. My mum was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer last year; she turns 67 this year. I mourn our old life more than anything which is natural I suppose. My mum was on targeted chemotherapy treatment but she’s had a new growth in her lower back which means a change of treatment to two varieties of chemo. I was hopefully she would last at least a couple of years on the targeted treatment before progression but what’s meant to be will be. The most frustrating part of this process is not knowing what is going to happen next. I keep telling myself I should be grateful she’s still here, seeing as when she was diagnosed I didn’t think she’d make it to the summer of last year let alone where we are. As for what happens after this existence; I can’t say I have a definitive belief on that but what I can say is my mum and I have conversations about death, not in a morbid way but just to talk about it. She always says if it’s her time to go all she asks is that she doesn’t suffer. As another commenter has written; energy cannot be destroyed, a part of our loved ones stays alive within us, that little piece of them and the love we felt for them is what we carry forward with us when they’re gone.
