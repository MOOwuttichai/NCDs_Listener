Dying4aCure,Have you looked at “Death With Dignity?” It may be available in your state. It’s self administered euthanasia. I want that as well.

EtonRd,"Check out this organization for resources and information and support around medically assisted dying. https://deathwithdignity.orgI’m very sorry for the loss of your aunt, but I’m going to report your post. Baking soda did not keep your aunt alive and we don’t have to put up with that crap here. It’s against the rules of the sub.Please don’t call choosing treatment “fighting”. That’s incredibly offensive. Because it says that choosing treatment, no matter what it does to your body and how little time it gives you, is a better and braver option then opting out of treatment to prioritize quality of life over quantity. I don’t think you understand how medically assisted dying works when you’re talking about going out in a blaze of glory.Stop calling choosing treatment “fighting”. that’s a judgmental and offensive way to refer to the choice between doing treatment no matter what the side effects are and how little there is of it giving significant time, choosing to stop treatment and focus on quality of life.

locololo61,"Please don't assume that you will ""become a vegetable"" before you die. My sister took treatment for stage 4 endometrial cancer with good results for nearly seven years. When she was informed that it had metastasized to her liver, she was given the choice of palliative care or hospice care. She chose hospice care, and it was the right choice for her. Her main concern was pain relief. She had at-home hospice, and pain-relieving medications were much more readily available through hospice than through palliative care. She remained home for six weeks, became weaker but still able to care for herself and gained valuable time with family and friends. She slept more, ate less, and used a walker, but remained alert and ""herself"". Up until the last 36 hours of her life, she was sitting up in bed, conversing with loved ones by phone, doing her daily crossword, etc. When she took a turn for the worse she was transported to the local hospital by ambulance, administered morphine for pain and to provide relaxation and comfort, fell asleep, slipped into a coma, and died peacefully that night. Concerned about costs? Her medicare and supplemental insurance covered every dime of her hospitalization, hospice care and meds. You can meet with hospice well in advance, check their reviews, and also check with your insurer.",1350,Unable to identify / not sure if it is,It may be useful or it may provide enough information.,Unable to identify/not sure if it is,Both genders are told.,Male,Tell other people's experiences,['No symptoms identified'],1,1,1,1
raw2082,"I lost my mom to stage 4 ovarian cancer. She was in treatment for 6.5 years, one year she was in remission and stayed on oral chemo. She lived her life during those years when she wasn’t sick from treatment. I did 4 months chemo as I was diagnosed with breast cancer a year and half after she passed and all I could think about was her and how the hell she managed treatment for that long. She had her reoccurrence in October started back on treatment and by January they told her that treatment wasn’t working so they downgraded to lower level of treatment and she was on that until July. She really started slowing down and not feeling well in June. At the end of July she was told there were no other options for her. They gave her 3 months to live and she made it a week. The last two days she was in a coma type state. I truly wished there were options to assist with the end of life because it was extremely tough to see her like that.

VelociraptorSparkles,"So our son had deep trauma regarding his inevitable death. He very clearly told his team he wanted to be placed in a coma, at home, once he couldn't deal with the pain anymore. Our hospice nurse took it upon herself to not follow the Dr's orders, we fired her once we realized she was not administering the medication and he woke up twice, but the new nurse followed protocol. It was as close to assisted we could get in our state.

dirkwoods,"Hopefully you can have real conversations with your physicians, particularly your Palliative Care team. Even in states without MAID you have some control. You might consider asking them to help you understand what it would look like if you stopped eating and drinking and only moistened your dry lips while getting narcotics. You may have to decide between having friends and family with you before you die and not having them ""watch you die before their eyes""- either they will be there or they won't and it is rarely as simple as in the movies. Again, the Palliative Care team should be discussing ""goals of care"" with you and the different ways things might look to meet your needs.
